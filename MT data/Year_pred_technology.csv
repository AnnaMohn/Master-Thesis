94813,"Challenges in developing effective policy for soil carbon sequestration: perspectives on additionality, leakage, and permanence","If carbon sequestration is to be a cost-effective substitute for reducing emissions then it must occur under a framework that ensures that the sequestration is additional to what would otherwise have occurred, the carbon is stored permanently, and any leakage is properly accounted for. We discuss significant challenges in meeting these requirements, including some not previously recognized. Although we focus on sequestration in soil, many of the issues covered are applicable to all types of sequestration. The common-practice method for determining additionality achieves its intention of reducing transaction costs in the short term but not in the medium to long term. Its design results in the least costly, additional abatement-measures being excluded from policy support and fails to address how, in the case of sequestration, revisions to the additionality of sequestering practices should apply not just to the future, but in theory, also retrospectively. Permanence is sometimes approximated as 100 years of sequestration. Re-release of sequestered carbon after this will not only reverse the sequestration, but may raise atmospheric carbon to higher levels than they would have been if the sequestration had never occurred. Leakage associated with sequestration practices can accumulate over time to exceed the total level of sequestration; nonetheless, adoption of such practices can be attractive to landholders, even when they are required to pay for this leakage at contemporary prices.Policy relevanceGlobally, much has been written and claimed about the ability to offset emissions with sequestration. The Australian Government plans to use sequestration to source much of the abatement required to reach its emissions targets. Designing effective policy for sequestration will be challenging politically, and will involve substantial transaction costs. Compromises in policy design intended to make sequestration attractive and reduce transaction costs can render it highly inefficient as a policy.",additionality; carbon credits; climate change mitigation; climate policy frameworks; environmental economics; sequestration,Article,2016.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.9176997542381288,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
897937,Policy instruments for limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C - can humanity rise to the challenge?,"In order to mobilize the volume of mitigation required to reach a global emissions path consistent with 1.5 degrees C, policy instruments need to be much more stringent than they have been to date. They will have to ensure full decarbonization of key economic sectors within one generation, which will require retirement of high-carbon assets before the end of their technical lifetime. However, political economy shows that only those instruments will be implemented that benefit well-organized interest groups while spreading costs as widely as possible. In the past, this has led to distortions such as emissions trading systems with systemic overallocation of allowances, or carbon taxes that exempt industry. Under favourable lobbying constellations strong subsidy schemes for mitigation can emerge. Renewable feed-in tariffs in Europe persisted for over two decades and were crucial for the breakthrough of wind and solar power technologies. But once competition from China led to the demise of European technology providers and the European population started to feel the pinch from the surcharges on their electricity bills, feed-in tariffs were abolished. Historically, rapid transformations of the nature required to reach 1.5 degrees C built on either lavish public investment into the underlying infrastructure or a general notion of national emergency. Innovative forms of market mechanisms could convince policy makers that mitigation costs are lower than expected and thus accelerate mitigation. For the long-term success of far-reaching mitigation policies, it will be crucial whether they can be framed as harnessing an opportunity or whether they are seen as a grim, but grudgingly accepted response to a societal emergency.",,Editorial Material,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.909087061882019,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
4817198,CCUS As a second-best choice for China's carbon neutrality: an institutional analysis,"The climate emergency calls for decisive actions to achieve CO2 emissions reductions globally and in China. Although China has made substantial progress in renewable energy deployment and has promised to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, the increasing CO2 emissions reflect a paradox in China's energy revolution, suggesting that second-best choices are necessary. Large-scale deployment of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) can avoid stranding assets in existing fossil energy industries and thus incur less resistance from incumbents. With an estimated storage capacity of 3120 GtCO(2), China has great potential to deploy CCUS. The more quickly CCUS scales up, the less the cost of mitigation in the future. Although China has issued many policies to promote CCUS development and achieved significant progress through demonstration projects, barriers still exist for its large-scale deployment. Barriers include the lack of CCUS-specific legal and regulatory models, relatively high investment requirements, and low public perception and acceptance towards CCUS. To effectively promote this second-best choice, institutional reforms are critical, including enabling climate change legislation, carbon tax policy, risk avoidance and risk sharing measures, compensation, and strengthened public engagement. Key policy insights Large-scale deployment of Negative Emission Technologies will be needed in China and beyond to address the climate emergency. Market distortions impede renewable energy development in China, making large-scale deployment of CCUS an essential second-best choice. Detailed legal and regulatory rule changes can reduce market uncertainties and provide a legal foundation and mandate for CCUS development. Particularly when source control measures - such as renewable energy deployment, industrial restructuring and energy efficiency improvements - face bottlenecks, the scaling up of negative emission technologies is essential. International cooperation on CCUS technologies and deployment should be strengthened to share experience, technology, and deployment modes.",CCUS; climate change; second-best theory; institutional reform,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.9072144031524658,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), with partners, has been exploring and developing new policy opportunities for coastal conservation using the climate benefits of these ecosystems. We detail NOAA's efforts (federal and international, market and non-market) to leverage blue carbon for coastal conservation including: (1) how blue carbon is or could be incorporated into U.S. federal policies (both existing and new policy activities); (2) market-based policy solutions including the development of a Verified Carbon Standard methodology for carbon credits for wetland restoration and two landscape assessments of the climate mitigation benefits of watershed-scale restoration; and (3) international efforts to build a North American community of practice for blue carbon science and policy with the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, Canada, and Mexico, and an assessment of where blue carbon can be incorporated into international policy frameworks (including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Wetlands Supplement and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)).

1048925,Towards an EU Regulatory Framework for Climate-Smart Agriculture: The Example of Soil Carbon Sequestration,"This article assesses current and proposed European Union (EU) climate and environmental law, and the legal instruments associated with the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), to see whether soil carbon sequestration is sufficiently promoted as a promising example of climate-smart agriculture'. The assessment shows that current and proposed policies and instruments are inadequate to stimulate large-scale adoption of soil carbon projects across Europe. Given the identified structural flaws, it is likely that this is true for all climate-smart agricultural practices. An alternative approach needs to be developed. Under EU climate policy, agriculture should be included in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) by allowing regulated industries to buy offsets from the agricultural sector, following the examples set by Australia and others. The second element of a new approach is aimed at the CAP, which needs to be far more focused on the specific requirements of climate change mitigation and adaptation. Yet, such stronger focus does not take away the need to explore new income streams for farmers from offsets under the ETS, as the CAP will never have sufficient funds for the deep and full transition of Europe's agriculture sector that is needed.",Climate change mitigation; Climate change adaptation; Food security; Common Agricultural Policy; Emissions trading; European Union,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.9049582481384276,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
2328120,Beyond carbon pricing: policy levers for negative emissions technologies,"This paper explores policies for Negative Emissions Technologies (NETs), in an attempt to move beyond the supply-side focus of the majority of NETs research, as well as the current dominance of carbon pricing as the main NETs policy proposal. The paper identifies a number of existing policies from four key areas - energy/transport, agriculture, sub-soil, and oceans - which will have an impact on three NETs: Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), Direct Air Capture (DAC), and terrestrial Enhanced Rock Weathering (ERW). We propose that non-climate co-benefits may be valuable in terms of the policy 'demand pull' for NETs; in particular, we find that ERW may provide multiple co-benefits which can be mandated through existing policy structures. However, interaction with numerous policy areas may also create barriers, particularly where there is tension between the priorities of different government departments. On the basis of existing and analogous policies from a range of geographical contexts and scales, this paper proposes four options for NETs policy that could be reasonably implemented in the near-term. We also argue that ERW demonstrates the importance of scale and framing, because the policy environment depends on whether it is framed as a soil amendment at local scales or as a climate stabilization technique at international scale. Key policy insights Co-benefits may assist the 'demand pull' for novel technologies by providing multiple policy angles for incentivisation rather than relying on a 'fix-all' policy such as a high carbon price. DAC with storage might be overly reliant on a high carbon price, because it only provides one core benefit - that of atmospheric carbon reduction. ERW may provide multiple co-benefits which can be mandated through existing policy structures, but should focus on using waste rock rather than mining virgin material. We propose four near-term options for NETs policy: funding for small-scale BECCS demonstration and an international biomass certification mechanism; small-scale loans for ERW on farms and promotion of locally-sourced rock residues; amendment of fertilizer subsidy schemes to include silicate rock; and a clearer framework for licensing sub-soil access for CO2 storage.",NETs; carbon dioxide removal; co-benefits; BECCS; enhanced rock weathering; direct air capture,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.9049131274223328,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5303446,Governing Net Zero Carbon Removals to Avoid Entrenching Inequities,"Climate change embeds inequities and risks reinforcing these in policies for climate change remediation. In particular, with policies designed to achieve “net zero” carbon dioxide, offsets may be considered inequitable if seen to avoid or delay gross emission reductions; offsets to emissions through technologically mature methods of carbon dioxide removals (CDR) require natural resources at scales threatening food security; knowledge of the potential of immature CDR is largely a global north monopoly; and CDR in particular environments is ill-understood and its implications for development unexamined. The use of CDR to contribute to robust progress toward Paris climate goals requires global agreement on simultaneously reducing emissions and enhancing removals, equity in burden sharing, and an interdisciplinary effort led by individual jurisdictions and focused on the co-development of technologies and governance to create CDR portfolios matched to local needs.

2522062,Protecting Antarctic blue carbon: as marine ice retreats can the law fill the gap?,"As marine-ice around Antarctica retracts, a vast 'blue carbon' sink, in the form of living biomass, is emerging. Properly protected and promoted Antarctic blue carbon will form the world's largest natural negative feedback on climate change. However, fulfilling this promise may be challenging, given the uniqueness of the region and the legal systems that govern it. In this interdisciplinary study, we explain: the global significance of Antarctic blue carbon to international carbon mitigation efforts; the urgent need for international legal protections for areas where it is emerging; and the hurdles that need to be overcome to realize those goals. In order to progress conservation efforts past political blockages we recommend the development of an inter-instrument governance framework that quantifies the sequestration value of Antarctic blue carbon for attribution to states' climate mitigation commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Key policy insights Blue-carbon emergence around Antarctica's coastlines will potentially store up to 160,000,000 tonnes of carbon annually. Blue-carbon will emerge in areas of rich biomass that will make it vulnerable to harvesting and other human activities; it is essential to incentivise conserving, rather than commercial exploitation of newly ice-free areas of the Southern Ocean. Antarctic blue carbon is a practical and prime candidate to build a cooperative, inter-instrument, non-market mitigation around; this should be considered at the 'blue COP' UN Climate change discussions in Spain. Allowing Antarctic fishing states to account for the carbon storage value of blue carbon zones through a non-market approach under the Paris Agreement could provide a vital incentive to their protection under the Antarctic Treaty System.

19278,Effective EU and Member State policies for stimulating CCS,"Although CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is widely recognised as an option to mitigate climate change, consistent and effective EU policies to advance CCS are still absent. This paper discusses policy instruments for advancing large-scale deployment of CCS in the European Union, and evaluates them in a multi-criteria analysis. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) is a cost-effective instrument for limiting greenhouse gas emissions, but it is questionable whether its currently limited time horizon and short-trading periods will lead to substantial CCS diffusion. Complementary policies at the EU and the Member State level may repair this and provide sufficient incentives for CCS. Potential policies include financial instruments such as investment subsidies, a feed-in scheme, or a CO2 price guarantee, as well as a CCS mandate or a low-carbon portfolio. These policy options differ with respect to their environmental effectiveness, possible interaction with the EU-ETS, costs and financial risk involved, and their competition with other mitigation options. Interactions between Member State policies and the EU-ETS are smaller in scope than those of EU-wide policies, but they are more likely to lead to displacement of financial resources from other low-carbon technologies. In addition, national policies may pose a significant part of the financial risk of CCS operations with Member States, reducing the operator's incentive to innovate. Overall, structural policies at the EU level, such as a mandate or a low-carbon portfolio standard would be more conducive for realising large-scale deployment of CCS across the EU as well as more acceptable to environmental organisations.

4685117,Payments for ecosystem services within the hybrid governance model: evaluating policy alignment and complementarity on California rangelands,"Governance of global natural resources is increasingly hybrid, with complementary public and private sector initiatives layered on landscapes to improve environmental outcomes. The challenge of polycentric land use governance is alignment of goals across diverse governance mechanisms when agricultural producers, public agencies, and corporations have distinct motivations. This case study of soil carbon governance on California rangelands explores a new payment for ecosystem services (PES) initiative led by the food and agriculture industry, called the Ecosystem Services Market Consortium (ESMC). Applying hybrid governance theory to agricultural lands, we conduct an ex-ante policy evaluation of potential policy impact based on (i) alignment between corporate sustainability goals and ranchers' priorities and (ii) complementarity of the ESMC market with existing public and private policies enabling rangeland conservation. We found corporations developing the PES market to be motivated by carbon insetting, the objectives of which converge with ranchers' goals of preserving soils. Each policy offers distinct benefits and challenges, with synergies around climate change adaptation and soil health. As a new policy tool, carbon markets like the ESMC are positioned to meet demand for soil health financing, support resilience and ranch productivity, and improve ranchers' access to soil health data for adaptive management. Given carbon markets' outcome-based payment structure, we highlight the importance of complementary governance mechanisms that mitigate upfront risk with financial and technical support during the transition period, including Farm Bill cost-share programs and private sector financing tools. This policy evaluation highlights the challenges and opportunities surrounding rangelands soil carbon governance, particularly the trade-offs that ranchers, corporations, and society at large must consider for landscape-scale conservation programs.",carbon markets; carbon insetting; climate adaptation; environmental governance; payments for ecosystem services; rangelands management,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.9003360271453857,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1838476,"California's Policy Approach to Develop Carbon Capture, Utilization and Sequestration as a Mitigation Technology","While California has been at the forefront in adopting an aggressive climate change mitigation policy, it has taken a more measured and tentative approach toward creating an enabling policy and a regulatory framework for carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CC-US) technologies to contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. In 2005, Governor's Executive Order S-3-05 required that California reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. In 2006, State Assembly Bill 32 codified the 2020 goal into law. In 2006, the California Legislature required two California agencies, the California Energy Commission and the Department of Conservation, to produce a report recommending how the state could facilitate commercial adoption of geologic sequestration from industrial sources. In 2010, three state agencies, the Energy Commission, Public Utilities Commission, and Air Resources Board, convened the California Carbon Capture and Storage Review Panel to make recommendations on specific policy, institutional, and regulatory changes necessary for California to enable commercial-scale carbon capture and geologic storage projects. Since 2006, several legislative bills have been introduced to establish regulatory authority, liability, and address pore space ownership issues, but none have made it into law. To meet the state's aggressive targets, especially the 2050 goal, will nevertheless require widespread adoption of CCUS technologies, according to studies by the California Council on Science and Technology. California contributes 7.5% of the total GHG emissions in the USA, or 1.8% of global GHG emissions. Over half of this currently is from point sources, but that proportion will increase as the state pursues electrification of the transportation sector. Trajectories of future GHG emissions growth suggest mitigation technologies must be implemented at rates on the order of 10-20 million tonnes of GHGs removed per year. The cap-and-trade system recently adopted in California to address the GHG reduction mandates of Assembly Bill 32 would seem to encourage pursuit CCUS technology projects by industrial emitters, hut uncertainties preclude developing viable business cases. Uncertainty includes a lack of data on the costs of capture and storage and the lack of cap-and-trade accounting protocols for CCUS technologies. Although these protocols are scheduled to be developed, they will lag the initialization of cap-and-trade in 2012. (C) 2013 The Authors.

3820157,Equity in allocating carbon dioxide removal quotas,"The first nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement include no mention of the carbon dioxide removal (CDR) necessary to reach the Paris targets, leaving open the question of how and by whom CDR will be delivered. Drawing on existing equity frameworks, we allocate CDR quotas globally according to Responsibility, Capability and Equality principles. These quotas are then assessed in the European Union context by accounting for domestic national capacity of a portfolio of CDR options, including bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, reforestation and direct air capture. We find that quotas vary greatly across principles, from 33 to 325 GtCO(2)allocated to the European Union, and, due to biophysical limits, only a handful of countries could meet their quotas acting individually. These results support strengthening cross-border cooperation while highlighting the need to urgently deploy CDR options to mitigate the risk of failing to meet the climate targets equitably. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be necessary to meet climate targets. Applying equity principles to allocate national CDR quotas shows a large variation across countries and principles, while within the EU domestic biophysical limits constrain individual capacity to achieve them.",,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8999298810958862,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
146418,Responding to the Kyoto Protocol through forestry: A comparison of opportunities for several countries in Europe,"Climate change has become an important environmental policy issue. Numerous carbon sequestration policy initiatives, potential benefits of which in environmental, economic and social terms could be substantial, are directed toward both woodland expansion and using of wood as a substitute for fossil fuels. There is a great deal of uncertainty, however, on how to define sustainability of such policies in a broadly acceptable and efficient way; how to translate sustainability requirements into policy guidelines; how to overcome market limitations and where to place biomass production in the general context of land use where contemporary agricultural change will likely be influential. On the basis of several countries from Europe (the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Slovakia, and Ukraine) this paper highlights social and economic problems of moderating carbon emissions through afforestation. It provides an indication of whether forestry can offer a socially acceptable and a low-cost opportunity for carbon uptake. The conclusion is that along with carbon sequestration potential, the level of land use integration and the stage of institutional development play important roles for effective implementation of climate policies. The necessity is then to link these policies with regional developments, and to back them up with adequate economic incentives, appropriate institutions and with public engagement in environmental decision-making.

This paper discusses several ways how CCS in the Dutch power sector can be stimulated after the round of demonstration activities up to 2015. It describes recent policy developments in the UK, US and Germany, and concludes that a policy package could be the most useful way forward if it includes a financial incentive to cover additional costs of CCS. The costs of financial support could amount to 1-3% of the Dutch electricity bill, even with CO2 prices in the (sic)20-50 range until 2030. A policy package could also include a regulatory instrument like an emissions performance standard (EPS) or other regulation for new coal-fired power plants to provide additional certainty.

2695629,Policy support for biochar: Review and recommendations,"Significant evidence has accumulated demonstrating that soil biochar amendment has many environmental benefits; however, adoption has been slow. This raises the question of how to align the environmental benefits with commercial motivations to drive more widespread implementation. Here, we examine the role that government policy can play in accelerating production and use at commercial scale. We identify three types of programs that can support biochar production: commercial financial incentives, nonfinancial policy support, and research and development funding. We also describe how these programs are currently used to support biochar production. For example, financial incentives can motivate immediate changes in business practices while nonfinancial policies can be important mechanisms to educate consumers and expand market demand. Research and development support can provide the necessary funding for early-stage innovations that may one day become commercially viable options, even without other types of policy support. There are different risk-reward profiles for each policy mechanism, and these must be considered when evaluating a policy direction. Finally, we offer broad recommendations to the development of policy that maximizes the net benefits of biochar adoption. Key recommendations include improving policies that allow for the monetization of environmental benefits and avoided costs, recognizing soil as a resource through national preservation policy, and developing a broadly accepted set of product standards for biochar.",biobased product policy; biochar; biochar adoption; biochar commercialization; biochar policy; financial incentive; policy incentive; soil health; US renewable products programs,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8993548154830933,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5075610,Delaying decarbonization: Climate governmentalities and sociotechnical strategies from Copenhagen to Paris,"An era (2005-2015) centered around the Copenhagen Accord saw the rise of several immature sociotechnical strategies currently at play: carbon capture and storage, REDD+, next-generation biofuels, shale gas, short-lived climate pollutants, carbon dioxide removal, and solar radiation management. Through a framework grounded in governmentality studies, we point out common trends in how this seemingly disparate range of strategies is emerging, evolving, and taking effect. We find that recent sociotechnical strategies reflect and reinforce governance rationalities emerging during the Copenhagen era: regime polycentrism, relative gains sought in negotiations, 'co-benefits' sought with other governance regimes, 'time-buying' or 'bridging' rationalities, and appeals to vulnerable demographics. However, these sociotechnical systems remain conditioned by the resilient market governmentality of the Kyoto Protocol era. Indeed, the carbon economy exercises a systemic structuring condition: While emerging climate strategies ostensibly present new tracks for signalling ambition and action, they functionally permit the delaying of comprehensive decarbonization.

4926140,A policy roadmap for negative emissions using direct air capture,"Negative emission strategies are central to avoiding catastrophic climate change. Engineered solutions such as direct air capture are far from cost-competitive. As past low-carbon technology transitions suggest, this calls for policy and political strategies beyond carbon pricing. We adopt a policy sequencing perspective that identifies policies that could create niche markets, building political support for later widespread deployment of direct air capture. Climate leaders could pursue an ""incentives + mandates"" policy strategy targeted at the oil and gas industry. These early moves could create global spillovers for follower countries by reducing technology cost and facilitating knowledge transfer through global firms. Negative emission technologies are central to avoiding catastrophic climate change.

1049028,Result-oriented Agri-Environmental Climate Schemes as a means of promoting climate change mitigation in olive growing,"The climate change mitigation potential of olive farming has been widely acknowledged. It has particular relevance in regions such as Andalusia (southern Spain) where olive growing is a key land use activity with significant social, economic and environmental implications. This potential of olive farming, however, is not adequately embodied in current Agri-Environmental Climate Schemes (AECS), which often fail to deliver the expected outcomes. The present article proposes an alternative strategy based on a result-oriented approach to AECS for enhancing soil carbon sequestration in Andalusian olive growing. After reviewing the current legal and institutional situation which forbids the wide application of result-oriented agri-environmental schemes, we suggest the use of alternative territorial governance arrangements, such as hybrid governance structures (HGS), as a framework to support the implementation of a result-oriented approach in the specific case of olive growing. Results indicate that the application of HGS can provide valuable benefits in terms of soil carbon storage.

517738,"California's policy approach to develop carbon capture, utilization and sequestration as a mitigation technology","While California has been at the forefront in adopting an aggressive climate change mitigation policy, it has taken a more measured and tentative approach toward creating an enabling policy and a regulatory framework for carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (CCUS) technologies to contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions. In 2005, Governor's Executive Order S-3-05 required that California reduce GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020 and to 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. In 2006, State Assembly Bill 32 codified the 2020 goal into law. In 2006, the California Legislature required two California agencies, the California Energy Commission and the Department of Conservation, to produce a report recommending how the state could facilitate commercial adoption of geologic sequestration from industrial sources. In 2010, three state agencies, the Energy Commission, Public Utilities Commission, and Air Resources Board, convened the California Carbon Capture and Storage Review Panel to make recommendations on specific policy, institutional, and regulatory changes necessary for California to enable commercial-scale carbon capture and geologic storage projects. Since 2006, several legislative bills have been introduced to establish regulatory authority, liability, and address pore space ownership issues, but none have made it into law. To meet the state's aggressive targets, especially the 2050 goal, will nevertheless require widespread adoption of CCUS technologies, according to studies by the California Council on Science and Technology. California contributes 7.5% of the total GHG emissions in the USA, or 1.8% of global GHG emissions. Over half of this currently is from point sources, but that proportion will increase as the state pursues electrification of the transportation sector. Trajectories of future GHG emissions growth suggest mitigation technologies must be implemented at rates on the order of 10-20 million tonnes of GHGs removed per year. The cap-and-trade system recently adopted in California to address the GHG reduction mandates of Assembly Bill 32 would seem to encourage pursuit CCUS technology projects by industrial emitters, but uncertainties preclude developing viable business cases. Uncertainty includes a lack of data on the costs of capture and storage and the lack of cap-and-trade accounting protocols for CCUS technologies. Although these protocols are scheduled to be developed, they will lag the initialization of cap-and-trade in 2012.",,Conference Paper,2013.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.897394597530365,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
363920,UK energy policy - Stuck in ideological limbo?,"Energy policy in the UK has undergone a paradigm change over recent decades from the free market stance of the 1990s to the more interventionist measures of the 21st century. However, the two approaches have not been reconciled - even as the Government intervenes, it reaffirms its goal of creating more competitive markets. The contradictions are most apparent with electricity, which has been the main focus of intervention to date, in line with decarbonisation strategy. Investment is dependent on Government support, which changes in response to circumstances, creating uncertainty and undermining the basis of market operation - so leading to the need for more intervention. The future for other sources - natural gas, nuclear power and carbon capture and storage in particular remains unclear. The Government risks getting the worst of both worlds - without the coordination and direction which could come from a centralised approach or the efficiencies and innovation which might emerge from a more consistent market based policy. Unless a fuller policy statement, expected later this year, can clarify matters, UK energy policy will not be fit for purpose and will fail to meet its key goals, of economic effectiveness, environmental protection and energy security.

4926148,Is carbon dioxide removal 'mitigation of climate change'?,"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is often characterized as separate from climate change mitigation. Discussion of CDR governance - despite enjoying growing interest - tends to overlook how key provisions on mitigation apply. Similarly, many climate policy processes have ignored CDR. CDR may have been discursively held separate from 'mitigation' due to a partial conceptual overlap with 'geoengineering'. We unpack how the 'mitigation of climate change' - as defined in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Paris Agreement - includes CDR as defined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. We point to important implications and opportunities for strengthening governance by enhanced clarity regarding parties' obligations, principled equitable distribution of removal efforts, prioritization of rapid emissions reductions and careful paths to long-term removals, and a need for considering sustainability and human rights issues in the pursuit of CDR.",,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8969178199768066,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
355121,Framing REDD plus in India: Carbonizing and centralizing Indian forest governance?,"This article analyzes the interaction of newly articulated climate governance goals with long-standing forest policies and practices in India. We focus on India's REDD+ (reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and related forest activities) strategy, with a particular focus on the Green India Mission (GIM). The GIM calls for a doubling of the area for afforestation and reforestation in India in the next decade as a dominant climate mitigation strategy. We analyze how the GIM policy document frames carbon versus noncarbon benefits to be derived from forest-related activities; and how the GIM envisages division of authority (between national, regional and local levels) in its implementation. We are interested in assessing (a) whether the GIM promotes a ""carbonization"" of Indian forest governance, i.e. an increased focus on forest carbon at the expense of other ecosystem services; and (b) whether it promotes an increased centralization of forest governance in India through retaining or transferring authority and control over forest resources to national and state-level authorities, at the expense of local communities. We argue that the GIM frames the climate-forest interaction as an opportunity to synergistically enhance both carbon and non-carbon benefits to be derived from forests; while simultaneously promoting further decentralization of Indian forest governance. However, based on past experiences and developments to date, we conclude that without significant investments in community-based carbon and biodiversity monitoring, as well as institutionalized benefit-sharing mechanisms that reach down to the local level, the posited REDD+-induced move toward more holistic and decentralized Indian forest governance is unlikely to take place.

4376832,A case study of Australia's emissions reduction policies - An electricity planner's perspective,"Australia offers an interesting case study of climate policy effectiveness as Australia has 'tried' a wide range of policies to mixed effect. Given that more than half of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions typically come from stationary energy generation, most climate policy in Australia has focussed on electricity sector reform, particularly the uptake of variable renewable energy and the decrease of thermal power generation. Electricity supply in Australia has undergone substantial change over recent years, substantially due to these policies, and needs to continue changing in the future to meet climate change mitigation targets and ensure stable, costeffective electricity supply. This paper is therefore written from the perspective of an electricity planner and seeks to learn from the experiences of climate policies tried over recent decades. We start by reviewing the history of Australian energy policy and a description of how the Australian electricity network is structured to operate. We examine the theory and effects of different policies tried, which range from renewable energy targets, carbon pricing schemes, subsidies for renewable energy and research and development initiatives. We make three key observations from the case analysis: (1) that there has been substantial expense and effort effectively wasted through duplicate effects of different policy mechanisms by both federal and state governments; (2) as various mechanisms enable variable renewable energy generation to increase, the market becomes distorted, increasing total system costs and decreasing system robustness and resilience; and (3) the narrowed focus of climate policy mechanisms on certain variable renewables, such as solar photovoltaic and wind generation, omitted the opportunity for uptake of scale-able low carbon, firm generation options, like nuclear power and carbon capture and storage.",Emissions reduction policy; Energy policy; Electricity; Market mechanisms; National electricity market,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8961173892021179,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
4686097,Incorporating blue carbon sequestration benefits into sub-national climate policies,"The emissions reduction pledges made by individual countries through the 2015 Paris Agreement represent the current global commitment to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the face of the enduring climate crisis. Natural lands carbon sequestration and storage are critical for successful pathways to global decarbonization (i.e., as a negative emissions technology). Coastal vegetated habitats maintain carbon sequestration rates exceeding forest sequestration rates on a per unit area basis by nearly two orders of magnitude. These blue carbon habitats and their associated carbon sequestration benefits are vulnerable to losses from land-use change and sea-level rise. Incorporation of blue carbon habitats in climate change policy is one strategy for both maintaining these habitats and conserving significant carbon sequestration capabilities. Previous policy assessments have found the potential for incorporation of coastal carbon sequestration in national-level policies, yet there has – to date – been little inclusion of blue carbon in the national-scale implementation of Paris commitments. Recently, sub-national jurisdictions have gained attention as models for pathways to decarbonization. However, few previous studies have examined sub-national level policy opportunities for operationalizing blue carbon into climate decision-making. California is uniquely poised to integrate benefits from blue carbon into its coastal planning and management and its suite of climate mitigation policies. Here, we evaluated legal authorities and policy contexts addressing sequestration specifically from blue carbon habitats. We synthesized the progressive action in California's approaches to mitigate carbon emissions including statutory, regulatory, and non-regulatory opportunities to incorporate blue carbon ecosystem service information into state- and local-level management decisions. To illustrate how actionable blue carbon information can be produced for use in decision-making, we conducted a spatial analysis of blue carbon sequestration in several locations in California across multiple agencies and management contexts. We found that the average market values of carbon sequestration services in 2100 ranged from $7,730 to $44,000 per hectare and that the social cost of carbon sequestration value was 1.3 to 2.7 times the market value. We also demonstrated that restoration of small areas with high sequestration rates can be comparable to the sequestration of existing marshes. Our results illustrate how accessible information about carbon sequestration in coastal habitats can be directly incorporated into existing policy frameworks at the sub-national scale. The incorporation of blue carbon sequestration benefits into sub-national climate policies can serve as a model for the development of future policy approaches for negative emissions technologies, with consequences for the success of the Paris Agreement and science-based decarbonization by mid-century. © 2020",,text,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8951367139816284,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1782743,Climate Change Policies and Issues: A Tool for Increased Wood Production in Developing Countries,"Climate change is a reality and forest trees are a major mitigating factor since they can sequester carbon dioxide and store carbon. Current climate change policy frameworks should address increased wood production in developing countries. The Kyoto Protocol (Article 3.3) should emphasize afforestation and reforestation while promoting increased use of wood products via wood recycling and good forest management. Sustainable forest management in Nigeria arising from global concern for climate change has led to increased afforestation programmes with the intensive taungya system and private establishment of many hectares of teak plantation in Nigeria. Ethiopia, Turkey, Kenya, and Mexico have planted 100-700 million trees under the UNEP tree planting programme initiative from 2006 to 2008. Legislation on Kyoto Protocol implementation may have to place emphasis on higher prices for trees that are to be given off (carbon trading) instead of being cut. A carbon tax incentive for tree planters will increase wood production and possible environmental protection. Those who contributed least to the atmospheric build-up of greenhouse gases are the least equipped to deal with the negative impacts; therefore, policies and issues in climate change should promote increased wood production in developing nations. The need to make policy issues in climate change to address increased wood production in developing nations is addressed in this paper.",Carbon trading; Climate change; Developing nations; Policy making; Wood production,Proceedings Paper,2011.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8941622972488403,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

While this is a well-understood technology with an important emission reduction potential, it requires a legal regime which affords sufficient certainty to operators about their potential liabilities. However, the European legal framework is perceived as achieving the opposite effect. The operator's liability is uncertain both in temporal and financial terms. This article considers that after the 2015 review of the CCS Directive, it is clear that at least a part in overcoming the industry's difficulties is more Member State action in the form of pragmatic interpretation and tailor-made agreements, as it is the case in the ROAD project.

Yet formal markets for ecosystem services in Panama are poorly developed. We assume that functioning markets for ecosystem services would partially counter development pressures on Panama's natural forests and ecosystems, and propose a suite of policy alternatives that could help develop such markets with the expectation that revenues would fund conservation and restoration efforts. These recommendations fall into five broad categories: (1) increase conservation of existing forests; (2) promote reforestation; (3) strengthen institutional capacity; (4) lower transaction costs; and (5) build the Panama brand for environmental services. A variety of fiscal, legal, organizational, and information-based approaches are recommended. In addition, we recommend convening a national Ecosystem Services Task-Force to organize diverse stakeholders and implement policy alternatives deemed most appropriate for advancing market development. We emphasize policy alternatives that are consonant with political and economic conditions in the country, that leverage outside funding, that recognize political feasibility, and that build upon existing legal and institutional frameworks. © 2007 The Haworth Press, Inc.

First, we examine the implications of a worst-case scenario in which no new CC is adopted internationally beyond what is in place in 2014. Second, we show the potential, under the original proposed subsidy, for the emergence of coordination failures capable of hampering the desired early CC deployment. We propose and evaluate modified schedules of tax-credits sufficient to overcome these concerns.

The P&I Team had the primary mission to provide information and advice to the CO2 Capture Project's Executive Board on these issues and any other external developments that may impact or benefit the technology program being developed by the CO2 Capture Project. The team completed two key tasks with results that are described in this paper. They are: A comprehensive survey of existing policies, regulations, and incentives that impact or benefit CO2 capture, injection and storage in geologic formations. Gap analysis necessary to formulate the regulatory and policy framework that will show how to get from ""where we are"" to ""where we want to be"" in deploying the technology.

The London Dumping Convention and the OSPAR Convention (Oslo Paris Convention) may apply to CO2 capture and storage deployment offshore in geologic formations.(1) Issues for clarification may require several years of intergovernmental negotiations in order to accommodate such deployment. In general, there is little policy and regulatory development specifically addressing CO2 capture and storage in individual countries. Specific countries (Netherlands, Norway, Canada, United Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US)) are moving in the direction of policy development specific to CO2 capture and storage. Public awareness is low to non-existent. Some non-government organizations (NGOs) will likely play key role in the public acceptance of the technology. Some NGOs and the public in the European Union are becoming slightly less skeptical of the technology. However, it is still too early to assess the level of public skepticism, which will become clearer when specific projects are reviewed for permitting or licensing. Existing and emerging financial incentives in Australia, Canada, the European Union, Denmark, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, the United Kingdom, and the United States are focused principally on research and development. Such incentives are needed to improve the cost-effectiveness for deploying CO2 capture and storage technology.

2514857,"Harnessing the climate mitigation, conservation and poverty alleviation potential of seagrasses: prospects for developing blue carbon initiatives and payment for ecosystem service programmes","Seagrass ecosystems provide numerous ecosystem services that support coastal communities around the world. They sustain abundant marine life as well as commercial and artisanal fisheries, and help protect shorelines from coastal erosion. Additionally, seagrass meadows are a globally significant sink for carbon and represent a key ecosystem for combating climate change. However, seagrass habitats are suffering rapid global decline. Despite recognition of the importance of ""Blue Carbon,"" no functioning seagrass restoration or conservation projects supported by carbon finance currently operate, and the policies and frameworks to achieve this have not been developed. Yet, seagrass ecosystems could play a central role in addressing important international research questions regarding the natural mechanisms through which the ocean and the seabed can mitigate climate change, and how ecosystem structure links to service provision. The relative inattention that seagrass ecosystems have received represents both a serious oversight and a major missed opportunity. In this paper we review the prospects of further inclusion of seagrass ecosystems in climate policy frameworks, with a particular focus on carbon storage and sequestration, as well as the potential for developing payment for ecosystem service (PES) schemes that are complementary to carbon management. Prospects for the inclusion of seagrass Blue Carbon in regulatory compliance markets are currently limited; yet despite the risks the voluntary carbon sector offers the most immediately attractive avenue for the development of carbon credits.

48492,Reframing the policy approach to greenhouse gas removal technologies,"Greenhouse gas removal (GGR) methods such as direct air capture, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, biochar and enhanced weathering have recently attracted attention as ""geoengineering"" options to reverse the build-up of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Contrary to this framing, however, we argue that GGR technologies can in fact form a valuable complement to emissions control within on-going mitigation efforts. Through decoupling abatement from emissions sources, they add much-needed flexibility to the mitigation toolbox, increasing feasibility and reducing costs of meeting climate targets. Integrating GGR effectively into policy raises significant challenges relating to uncertain costs, side effects, life-cycle effectiveness and accounting. Delaying policy action until these uncertainties are resolved, however, risks missing early opportunities, suffocating innovation and locking out the long-term potential of GGR. Based on an analysis of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, we develop four policy principles to begin unlocking the potential of GGR: (i) support further research, development and demonstration; (ii) support near-term opportunities through modifying existing policy mechanisms; (iii) commit to full GGR integration in carbon accreditation and broader climate policy frameworks in future; (iv) develop sector-specific steps that lay the groundwork for future opportunities and avoid lock-out (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Greenhouse gas removal; Geoengineering; Climate change policy,Article,2015.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8928224444389343,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
5338300,Land Use and Agriculture: Pitfalls and Precautions on the Road to Net Zero,"Land use is a crucial sector in delivering enhanced carbon sequestration globally. At the same time food production is a major source of global greenhouse gas emissions. As pressure mounts for all nations to increase their levels of ambition under the Paris Climate Agreement, so the pressure to radically reduce emissions from the agriculture sector and enhance carbon sequestration in the land use sector also ramps up. This trend is most clearly evident in the drive for “net zero” where unavoidable emissions, such as those from food production, are balanced by more sequestration via land use change. Here we examine some of the major risks, applicable safeguards, and potential pathways for agriculture and land use in realizing net zero. Using the UK as an example we highlight the importance of governance, finance, skills, research and technology, and society in this transition. We conclude that successful land use policy for net zero will require extremely demanding levels of integration and spatial resolution, and that the research community has a vital role to play in providing a robust evidence base for this. We also invoke the Cancun safeguards as a basis on which a more sustainable and just transition to net zero might be based. Finally, we warn of unintended distortions to policy and markets if the drive for net zero is too blinkered.

Despite this, carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is not yet firmly on national or global policy agendas. Owing to uncertainty about both technical potential and social license, it is unclear whether CDR on the required scale will even be feasible. This article asks what scholarship about the provision of global public goods can tell us about governing CDR. We identify four areas where new international cooperative efforts-likely performed by small clubs of motivated actors-could amplify existing CDR policy responses: development of CDR accounting and reporting methodologies, technology development and prototype deployment for technically challenging CDR, development of incentives for CDR deployment, and work on governance and accountability mechanisms that respond to social justice impacts and social license concerns.",,Article,2022.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.892116129398346,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

However, currently their costs are estimated to be very high, NETs do not seem to offer co-benefits besides mitigating climate change and there are significant concerns regarding possible negative impacts of their large-scale implementation on sustainable development. Costs can vary significantly due to locational factors such as availability of biomass resources and geological storage capacity. It will be up to progressive industrialized countries to take first steps to mobilize the mitigation potential of NETs. In order to understand whether NETs can provide a significant contribution to mitigation, financial incentives are needed that allow implementing the most attractive NET activities at the global scale. We see the market mechanism under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement - colloquially called 'Sustainable Development Mechanism' - as a possible cornerstone of such a policy instrument. While initially NETs will not be competitive on the free market, the mechanism can facilitate bilateral financial transfers for NETs, where mitigation units accrue to the financier. We discuss the functions and design elements that an international policy instrument may need to fulfil to successfully mobilize NETs.

353390,"Ocean iron fertilization: Science, law, and uncertainty","Introduction. The international community’s efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through traditional regulatory strategies under the Kyoto Protocol have reached a critical turning point. The Kyoto Protocol expired in 2012. Much-anticipated international climate change negotiations were conducted in December 2009 in Copenhagen, in December 2010 in Cancun, and in December 2011 in Durban, to determine what type of international agreement would succeed the Kyoto Protocol. In the wake of these Conferences of the Parties (COPs) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, there appears to be little hope for a binding and effective successor agreement to Kyoto that would include the full participation of the major industrial nations and major emerging economies necessary to ensure its success This uncertain future for traditional international climate change regulation has prompted a corresponding interest in deliberate interventions in the earth’s climate system to address global climate change; these are commonly known as climate geoengineering techniques. Climate geoengineering has come a long way within the past few years from being considered “fringe science” to finding a place in the mainstream of international climate change in the Cancun negotiations. © Cambridge University Press 2013.",,CHAP,2010.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8918885588645935,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
4230994,Forest policy and management approaches for carbon dioxide removal,"Forests increasingly will be used for carbon dioxide removal (CDR) as a natural climate solution, and the implementation of forest-based CDR presents a complex public policy challenge. In this paper, our goal is to review a range of policy tools in place to support use of forests for CDR and demonstrate how concepts from the policy design literature can inform our understanding of this domain. We explore how the utilization of different policy tools shapes our ability to use forests to mitigate and adapt to climate change and consider the challenges of policy mixes and integration, taking a close look at three areas of international forest policy, including the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) and voluntary carbon offset markets. As it is our expertise, we then examine in detail the case of the USA as a country that lacks aggressive implementation of national climate policies but has potential to increase CDR through reforestation and existing forest management on both public and private land. For forest-based CDR to succeed, a wide array of policy tools will have to be implemented in a variety of contexts with an eye towards overcoming the challenges of policy design with regard to uncertainty in policy outcomes, policy coherence around managing forests for carbon simultaneously with other goals and integration across governance contexts and levels.",climate mitigation; natural climate solution; REDD plus; US Forest Service; policy design; policy tools,Review,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8917171359062195,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
467045,From demonstration to deployment: An economic analysis of support policies for carbon capture and storage,"This paper argues that an integrated policy architecture consisting of multiple policy phases and economic instruments is needed to support the development of carbon capture and storage (CCS) from its present demonstration phase to full-scale deployment. Building on an analysis of the different types of policy instruments to correct market failures specific to CCS in its various stages of development, we suggest a way to combine these into an integrated policy architecture. This policy architecture adapts to the need of a maturing technology, meets the requirement of policymakers to maintain flexibility to respond to changing circumstances while providing investors with the policy certainty that is needed to encourage private sector investment. This combination of flexibility and predictability is achieved through the use of 'policy gateways' which explicitly define rules and criteria for when and how policy settings will change. Our findings extend to bioenergy-based CCS applications (BECCS), which could potentially achieve negative emissions. We argue that within a framework of correcting the carbon externality, the added environmental benefits of BECCS should be reflected in an extra incentive. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

901040,The post-carbon society: Rethinking the international governance of negative emissions,"This article makes an early attempt at connecting political science insights on the politics of carbon sequestration to a growing demand for knowledge about the potentials of negative emissions. Negative emissions from sequestering carbon is likely to be vital for fulfilling the 2 C target. Thus, this article is a reality check on what states actually plan to do. Based on key states' nationally determined contributions (NDCs) to the international climate regime and off-the-record interviews with senior country representatives to the 2016 climate meeting in Marrakech, we find that states generally do not have policies to promote large-scale carbon sequestration or negative emissions. However, many states wish to make the most of terrestrial sinks, using current regime rules as part of their mitigation portfolios. We suggest that national strategies to promote negative emissions will remain absent until the international climate regime formalizes rules and incentives for such efforts, recognizing them as legitimate national contributions. Without a governance framework that admits such efforts, national initiatives on large-scale negative emissions cannot fulfill the purpose of climate policy in a two-level setting matching national interests and international commitments.",Negative emissions technologies (NETs); CCS; LULUCF; REDD+,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.891189694404602,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Using an expert elicitation, historical data on the determinants of technological change in energy, values from the engineering literature, and demand estimates from an integrated assessment model, we simulate ranges of outcomes between 2025 and 2095. We introduce probability distributions of all important parameters and propagate them through the model to generate probability distributions of electricity costs, abatement costs, and CO2 avoided over time. Carbon pricing has larger effects than R&D and subsidies. But much of the range of outcomes is driven by uncertainty in other parameters, such as capital costs and returns to scale. Availability of other low carbon technologies, particularly bioenergy with CCS affects outcomes. Subsidies have the biggest impacts when they coincide with expanding manufacturing scale of CCS components. Our results point to 4 parameters for which better information is needed for future work informing technology policy to address climate change: capital costs, demonstration plants, growth constraints, and knowledge spillovers among technologies.",Carbon capture; Technological change; Climate policy,Article,2015.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.890494704246521,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
234635,How the global and national levels interrelate in climate policymaking: Foreign Policy Analysis and the case of Carbon Capture Storage in Norway's foreign policy,"States struggle to develop adequate climate change mitigation policies, especially when national energy interests conflict with collective environmental concerns. It is therefore crucial to understand how viable solutions may find political support on these terms. As one such case, this paper examines Norway's explicit foreign policy to promote Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) as a mitigation measure. I suggest that a Foreign Policy Analysis framework with a norm-centered constructivist focus allows for new in-sights into how climate policies function as balancing strategies between external normative pressures and important domestic concerns. It reveals how Norway's CCS policy represents an extraordinary effort to bridge seemingly contradictory agendas. The Norwegian CCS case highlights how a state may engage in innovative foreign political engineering to promote solutions to its international climate commitments on terms that fit national energy needs. It shows that climate political success may depend on successfully linking the international and domestic levels by simultaneously appealing to established norms within each system.

5337572,European Forest Governance: Status Quo and Optimising Options with Regard to the Paris Climate Target,"This article assesses and develops policy instruments for forest governance in the EU. Methodologically, it examines opportunities and limits for negative emissions by means of a literature review. On this basis, it conducts a qualitative governance analysis of the most important instruments of EU forest policy and presents optimizing policy options, measured against the binding climate and biodiversity targets under international law. Our analysis shows that the potential benefits of afforestation and reforestation for climate mitigation are overestimated, and are often pre-sented as the new saviours to assist in reaching climate neutrality, inter alia, since only biodiverse and thus resilient forests can function as a carbon sink in the long term. Furthermore, we demon-strate that the existing EU law fails to comply with climate and biodiversity targets. Quantity governance systems for livestock farming, fossil fuels and similar drivers of deforestation represent a more promising approach to forest governance than the dominant regulatory and subsidy-based governance. They are most effective when not directly addressing forests due to their heterogeneity but central damaging factors such as fossil fuels and livestock farming. Selected aspects of regulatory and subsidy law can supplement these quantity governance systems when focusing on certain easily attainable and thus controllable subjects. These include, e.g., the regulatory protection of old-growth forests with almost no exceptions and a complete conversion of all agricultural and forest subsidies to “public money for public services” to promote nature conservation and afforestation. © 2022 by the authors.

1779853,The evolution of European CCS policy,"The European Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) industry is still grasping for an effective policy structure which will support deployment of commercial CCS projects. This paper will consider the current context of CCS policy given three significant developments: (a) the agreement in 2014 for a technology neutral 2030 EU emissions reduction target; (b) a binding commitment at COP21 in Paris, Dec 2015, for a global emissions reduction target; (c) the collapse of the UK's CCS Commercialisation Programme in Nov 2015. The period 2010-2015 saw continued stagnation in the European CCS industry, with a series of projects proposed but then subsequently cancelled. This hints as three problems (1) an industry which is weak in communicating why CCS is important, and failed to engage a wider stakeholder base; (2) incumbent governments which are not willing to fund the initially high costs of the first CCS projects; (3) weak market based structures which force industrial consortia to rely on government subsidy, thus leaving projects vulnerable to political forces. The tension within the UK's Commercialisation Programme could still offer lessons for other potential CCS projects in Europe; and inform policy developments at the UK and European level. Namely (i) payment flows between the emitter / capture plant to the transport & storage provider, and the risk apportionment between those partners; (ii) the cost-benefit of oversized infrastructure and the challenges of a first project to finance the bulk of these costs. A recent report to the UK government on CCS recommended state-owned companies delivering all aspects of CCS, but such a recommendation makes it all too easy for a centre-right party focussed on smaller government and tight expenditure to dismiss CCS as ""too difficult"". An alternative would be normal commercial and market arrangements for the power & capture section; and a regulated monopoly for the transport & storage infrastructure, backed by the state for risk and liabilities.

659330,Joint implementation: an effective instrument of North-South environmental co-operation?,"There are doubts whether Annex I countries would be able to meet their emission-reduction commitments under the Rio Treaty, quite apart from the question of adequacy of commitments. Against this background, joint implementation (JI) is fast emerging as a complementary policy tool through which reductions in global carbon emissions could be achieved. This paper puts the issue of JI into context, including a hypothetical reforestation example, and addresses the question of whether it can work. The main finding is that although the potentials are huge, it cannot be taken for granted that joint implementation would produce the desired results. There are a number of pitfalls to watch out for if the potential contribution of this instrument is to be actualised. It is argued that the real advantage of the JI approach lies, not so much in short-term emission reduction or carbon sequestration, but in the longer term when projects based on environmentally relevant technology transfer successfully alter the energy-efficiency path of developing countries. The need for a guiding legal framework, a more direct role for private business, and the need for LDCs to be allowed to trade their share of emission-reduction credits constitute the main recommendations of the paper. © 1996 International Energy Initiative, Inc.",,JOUR,1996.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8897038102149963,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
678739,From rights to responsibilities: Reconceptualising carbon sequestration rights in Australia,"Biosequestration of carbon in trees, forests and vegetation is a key method for mitigating climate change in Australia. To facilitate this, all States have enacted legislation for carbon sequestration rights, separating commercial rights in carbon from ownership of the land, trees and vegetation in which the carbon is sequestered. Ownership of carbon sequestration rights under State law is a prerequisite for the issue of carbon credits to proponents of ""eligible sequestration offsets projects"" under the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011 (Cth) (Carbon Farming Act). This article examines the extent to which current State carbon sequestration rights support the offsets regime established by the Carbon Farming Act. The Commonwealth Act is concerned with allocating responsibilities to ensure the maintenance of the carbon sequestration, while the State Acts confer commercial rights in the carbon and leave the responsibilities to be allocated by private agreements.

2209522,Analysis and recommendations for European carbon dioxide utilization policies,"Due to lower-cost energy supplies elsewhere, Europe needs resource efficient technologies to safeguard the competitiveness of its energy-intensive industries. The technical feasibility of the CCU value chain components (carbon capture, transportation and utilization) has been widely studied in literature. However infrastructural, regulatory and business strategic issues have received less attention. A review of the relevant policies (e.g. European Emissions Trading Scheme, Renewable Fuels and Waste Directives) has been performed. Stakeholder engagement and the stakeholder influence mapping was used to examine potential climate change, circular economy, renewable energy and regional industrial development policies that can support CO2 utilization value chains. The main contribution of the paper is to outline potential benefits of policies to foster the production and uptake of CO2-derived products such as methanol, polyurethane and mineral construction aggregates. Another outcome is to illustrate the role of key policy-making stakeholders in assessing the suitability of current statutes and the impact of potential changes. An important finding was that the development of connectivity infrastructure is a key missing enabler and more attention to policy on infrastructure is required. Finally, the work examines the justification for a CO2 Utilization Directive, comparable to the Carbon Capture and Storage Directive, but considering the current complexity of the European Union (EU) policy landscape. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8894092440605164,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The policy is also supported by the issuance of fiscal, non-fiscal, and regional incentives. In Law Number 3 of 2020, the government of Indonesia states six types of coal downstream: coal upgrading; coal briquetting; cokes making; coal liquefaction; coal gasification; and coal slurry, yet the government has not defined which downstream coal products should be prioritized. Several parameters must be considered in implementing the downstream coal policy, those are the availability of coal and its characteristics, proven technology, economic and environmental feasibility.

879360,International carbon policies as a new driver for peatland restoration,"Introduction When - in 2006 - experts and advocacy groups for the first time raised the issue of GHG emissions from degraded peatlands at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), they met with negotiators, many of whom had never heard of ‘peat’ in the first place. Six years later, the UNFCCC allowed countries to comply with their reduction commitments by peatland rewetting and included peat soils in the REDD+ mechanism to reduce emissions from tropical deforestation. After years of neglect, peatlands have gained the attention that they deserve in the face of their enormous emissions and mitigation potential (Chapter 4). This chapter discusses the potentials and complications of using climate change mitigation policies for stimulating and financing peatland restoration using the Climate Convention, in the context of voluntary carbon markets and through policies with indirect climate targets. Many land use-oriented mitigation mechanisms have been developed with a forest bias, i.e. from the perspective of biomass carbon stocks. In using existing approaches to address peatlands, concepts and criteria thus have to be modified, complemented or newly developed to accommodate the specific peculiarities of peatlands - often after wearying awareness raising. Market-based instruments are recognised as important elements of the international climate finance architecture. Since the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol (2005), about 3 billion Kyoto units, each of these representing 1 t CO2e, have been traded at least once for prices ranging from less than 1 EUR per unit to 20 EUR and more. The annual market value of national and subnational cap-and-trade systems (outside Kyoto) stands at USD 30 billion (World Bank 2014). These large sums, in combination with the huge carbon stocks in peatlands, have nurtured the idea that peatland restoration is an effective way of tapping into climate finance. However, reality is more complicated - as this chapter will show. Beyond carbon trading proper, this chapter also addresses some future options for stimulating peatland restoration. Large peatland emissions occur both in industrialised and developing countries (Figure 15.1), and the ongoing negotiations within the post-2020 climate framework offer various opportunities to create peatland restoration incentives. © British Ecological Society 2016.",,Book Chapter,2016.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8884962797164917,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5241936,Incorporating blue carbon sequestration benefits into sub-national climate policies,"The emissions reduction pledges made by individual countries through the 2015 Paris Agreement represent the current global commitment to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in the face of the enduring climate crisis. Natural lands carbon sequestration and storage are critical for successful pathways to global decarbonization (i. e., as a negative emissions technology). Coastal vegetated habitats maintain carbon sequestration rates exceeding forest sequestration rates on a per unit area basis by nearly two orders of magnitude. These blue carbon habitats and their associated carbon sequestration benefits are vulnerable to losses from land-use change and sea-level rise. Incorporation of blue carbon habitats in climate change policy is one strategy for both maintaining these habitats and conserving significant carbon sequestration capabilities. Previous policy assessments have found the potential for incorporation of coastal carbon sequestration in national-level policies, yet there has - to date - been little inclusion of blue carbon in the national-scale implementation of Paris commitments. Recently, sub national jurisdictions have gained attention as models for pathways to decarbonization. However, few previous studies have examined sub-national level policy opportunities for operationalizing blue carbon into climate decision-making. California is uniquely poised to integrate benefits from blue carbon into its coastal planning and management and its suite of climate mitigation policies. Here, we evaluated legal authorities and policy contexts addressing sequestration specifically from blue carbon habitats. We synthesized the progressive action in California's approaches to mitigate carbon emissions including statutory, regulatory, and non-regulatory opportunities to incorporate blue carbon ecosystem service information into state-and local-level management decisions. To illustrate how actionable blue carbon information can be produced for use in decision making, we conducted a spatial analysis of blue carbon sequestration in several locations in California across multiple agencies and management contexts. We found that the average market values of carbon sequestration services in 2100 ranged from $7,730 to $44,000 per hectare and that the social cost of carbon sequestration value was 1.3 to 2.7 times the market value. We also demonstrated that restoration of small areas with high sequestration rates can be comparable to the sequestration of existing marshes. Our results illustrate how accessible information about carbon sequestration in coastal habitats can be directly incorporated into existing policy frameworks at the sub-national scale. The incorporation of blue carbon sequestration benefits into sub-national climate policies can serve as a model for the development of future policy approaches for negative emissions technologies, with consequences for the success of the Paris Agreement and science-based decarbonization by mid-century.",Ecosystem services; Climate mitigation; Blue carbon; Carbon sequestration; Carbon budget; Climate policy; Nature-based solutions,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8883044719696045,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
709587,Planning for offshore CO2 storage: Law and policy in the United Kingdom,"'Offshore CO2 storage' refers to the injection of liquefied CO2 into deep geological formations beneath the seabed (e.g. depleted oil and gas reservoirs, and saline aquifers) for the purpose of storing it there on a permanent basis. The storage in this manner of captured CO2 emissions from industrial installations and power plants has attracted considerable scientific and technical interest as a potential mitigation response to climate change. A key issue facing policymakers in several countries is how to reconcile policy commitments to develop offshore CO2 storage with other competing - and potentially conflicting - uses of the marine environment. With a view to informing policy responses to this issue, this paper presents a case study of legal and policy frameworks concerning offshore CO2 storage in United Kingdom. The paper maps key design features of the United Kingdom's framework for marine permitting and planning, appraising the extent to which they enable orderly development of offshore CO2 storage in a manner consistent with relevant high-level policy objectives.

514137,Climate change and deforestation: The evolution of an intersecting policy domain,"Forests and climate change are increasingly dealt with as interconnected policy issues. Both the potential synergies and policy conflicts between forest conservation and restoration and climate change mitigation now receive sustained and high level attention from academic, policy analysis and practitioner communities across the globe. Arguably the most pronounced contemporary policy manifestation of this is the debate on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (or REDD+) by which governments and private investors from developed countries may compensate actors in tropical forest countries for reducing forest loss beneath an agreed baseline. Problems of climate-forest policies implementation and governance, however, can also be found in countries such as Canada, the USA, the UK and Australia. The future of instruments like REDD+ is uncertain with growing critiques on payment and performance-based mechanisms and unresolved issues of governance, government and accountability. This paper, and the special issue it introduces, illustrates that in the REDD+ debate many contentious issues have resurfaced from past debates. These issues include the participation and rights of local communities in forest policy and management; the relationship between internationally agreed payment and performance-based programmes and formal democratic decision-making processes and structures; the complexities of rights to carbon versus tenure rights; and the ways in which - in spite of the high expectations of both developing and developed countries to combat carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation through the REDD+ mechanism - effective climate-focused forestry policies are seldom found in most tropical forest-rich countries. REDD+ is now very much the dominant discourse at the forest-climate interface, and one with a primary focus on measurability to communicate carbon mitigation results across various levels. However, this serves to disperse and displace, rather than resolve, policy-making on non-carbon values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

311718,The Potential Role for Management of U.S. Public Lands in Greenhouse Gas Mitigation and Climate Policy,"Management of forests, rangelands, and wetlands on public lands, including the restoration of degraded lands, has the potential to increase carbon sequestration or reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions beyond what is occurring today. In this paper we discuss several policy options for increasing GHG mitigation on public lands. These range from an extension of current policy by generating supplemental mitigation on public lands in an effort to meet national emissions reduction goals, to full participation in an offsets market by allowing GHG mitigation on public lands to be sold as offsets either by the overseeing agency or by private contractors. To help place these policy options in context, we briefly review the literature on GHG mitigation and public lands to examine the potential for enhanced mitigation on federal and state public lands in the United States. This potential will be tempered by consideration of the tradeoffs with other uses of public lands, the needs for climate change adaptation, and the effects on other ecosystem services.",Public lands; Climate change; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Carbon offsets; Climate policy,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8872305750846863,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5213228,The Application of the Environment Act 2021 Principles to Carbon Capture and Storage,"Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a new technology considered to have the potential to decarbonise economies. However, nationally and internationally the use of CCS has also been raising concerns about its potential global risks and adverse impacts on the environment. CCS was part of the discussions at the fourth United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) in March 2019 and in side-events in the 26th UN Climate Change Conference that took place in Glasgow in November 2021. The UK Government aims to deploy CCS at scale during the 2030s, subject to cost reduction. At the same time, the UK Government has recently enacted the Environment Act 2021, which provides a set of five environmental principles: the integration principle, the principle of preventative action, the precautionary principle, the rectification at source principle and the polluter pays principle. This work seeks to analyse the application of the UK environmental law principles to carbon capture and storage policies in the United Kingdom and its balance with other considerations. Given the concerns surrounding the use of CCS, the debate about its legality may arise in the United Kingdom and in other countries. To this end, this paper initially carries out a systematic review of CCS policy documents to discover the policy considerations that support the development of CCS. It then examines the application of the UK environmental law principles to CCS initiatives and its balance with other considerations, such as reduction of carbon emissions, security of energy supply, economic growth and technological leadership. In doing so, this paper aims at contributing to the debate surrounding recent technological developments that have been utilised to help address climate change and some of the legal challenges emerging through the use of CCS under UK environmental law.",environmental law principles; carbon capture and storage; energy; climate change,Article,2022.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.887119472026825,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
366049,United States policy for mitigating global climate change,"The primary objective of this paper is to explain current U.S. policy on global climate change. U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) efforts to implement this policy will be described. A secondary objective of this paper is to discuss from a U.S. perspective the social and political efforts which must be initiated in order for ocean storage of CO2 to be considered as a viable CO2 mitigation option. The fact that the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) has not been successful in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is now recognized. Thus, U.S. policy has shifted towards the development of binding medium-term emissions targets and long-term atmosphere concentration goals. The U.S. believes these goals can be accomplished through the adoption of cost-effective joint implementation agreements and international emissions trading mechanisms. Studies are currently underway to assess specific targets and timetables for emissions reductions. Voluntary efforts on the part of U.S. industry have proven to be extremely successful in reducing U.S. CO2 emissions. The U.S. electric utility industry has taken the lead in voluntarily lowering greenhouse gas emissions under the DOE Climate Challenge Program. As of August, 1996, nearly 600 utility participants, accounting for over 60% of electric power generation in the U.S. have joined the program. Areas of research interest to DOE include the development of high efficiency advanced power generation cycles and CO2 sequestration technology. The U.S. currently spends $1.6 billion on understanding global climate phenomena and only $1.6 million on CO2 mitigation research. A number of socio-political considarations must be looked at in assessing the feasibility of ocean storage of CO2.

5343978,The Promise of Blue Carbon Climate Solutions: Where the Science Supports Ocean-Climate Policy,"The ocean is gaining prominence in climate change policy circles as a tool for addressing the climate crisis. Blue carbon, the carbon captured and stored by marine and coastal ecosystems and species, offers potential as a “nature-based solution” to climate change. The protection and restoration of specific ocean ecosystems can form part of a climate response within climate mitigation policies such as Nationally Determined Contributions under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. For mitigation policies that seek to implement management actions that drawdown carbon, ecosystem sequestration and emissions must be measurable across temporal and spatial scales, and management must be practical leading to improved sequestration and avoided emissions. However, some blue carbon interventions may not be suitable as a climate mitigation response and better suited for other policy instruments such as those targeted toward biodiversity conservation. This paper gives context to numerous blue carbon sequestration pathways, quantifying their potential to sequester carbon from the atmosphere, and comparing these sequestration pathways to point-source emissions reductions. The applicability of blue carbon is then discussed in terms of multiple international policy frameworks, to help individuals and institutions utilize the appropriate framework to reach ocean conservation and climate mitigation goals.

1051266,Horizontal policy coherence starts with problem definition: Unpacking the EU integrated energy-climate approach,"The existing policy coherence literature usually takes problem definition for granted. Building on the case of the Energy Policy for Europe we argue that a focus on shifting problem definitions adds depth to the analysis of policy coherence as it allows us to problematize the standard on which the judgment of coherence is based. We further argue that problem definition is instrumental in enabling certain horizontal policy options. Empirically, the European Union's (EU's) support of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies illustrates that policy coherence between EU energy and environmental policies is increasingly conceptualized as an integrated approach headed for climate change mitigation and a low-carbon economy. We show that by shifting the focus of policy integration and coherence from environment to climate policy, CCS moved from the margins to the center of available policy options. Arguably, this comes at the expense of coherence if viewed from a broader sustainable development perspective.",carbon capture and storage; climate change; discourse; energy policy; low-carbon economy; policy coherence; problem definition; sustainable development,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8868811726570129,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
5219447,Climate change mitigation on tropical peatlands: A triple burden for smallholder farmers in Indonesia,"The agricultural use and conversion of tropical peatlands is considered a major source of land-based greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the protection and restoration of tropical peatlands has recently turned into an important strategy to mitigate global climate change. Little research exists that has investigated the impacts and dynamics that such climate mitigation efforts evoke in local communities living in and around peatlands. We present in-sights on this from Sumatra, Indonesia and use a climate justice lens to evaluate local outcomes. We show how an increasingly transnational network of state and non-state actors has become involved in developing new laws, policy programs and land-use agreements on Sumatra's coastal peatlands, aiming at supposedly win-win low-carbon development pathways. We argue that such efforts are open to much of the same criticism that has been raised regarding previous policies and projects aimed at reducing GHGE from deforestation and forest degradation. These projects disregard local perspectives on development, fail to deliver the promised benefits and, through a reconfiguration of local land-use rights, reduce the capabilities of smallholder farmers to benefit from their land. In sum, our analysis suggests that recent policies and projects aimed at mitigating GHGE from tropical peatlands contribute to a redistribution of the global climate mitigation burden onto smallholder farmers in Indonesia. This occurs through their threefold assignment to protect forests, prevent fires and help restore degraded peatlands.",Climate change mitigation; Climate justice; Indonesia; Peat fires; Peatland restoration; REDD plus,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8868088722229004,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Crude solutions from international and European law,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a crucial element of the energy transition that must take place over the next decades to tackle climate change. In recent years, the political momentum for CCS has increased and Norway is ready to deploy its first full-chain industrial CCS project. The Norwegian government hopes that, in time, this project will expand into a European CCS network. The carbon dioxide (CO2) will be carried by ships for much of the distance. While there are in principle no legal barriers to the ship transport of CO2, this article argues that international and European law are not ready yet to accommodate the ship carriage of CO2. First, the method for overcoming the Article 6 obstacle of the London Protocol reflects what has been politically achievable and not what would be legally desirable. Second, regarding the future Hazardous and Noxious Substances Convention's Fund, the article argues that CCS is a special case and certain concessions would be warranted.

192938,Designer policy for carbon and biodiversity co-benefits under global change,"Carbon payments can help mitigate both climate change and biodiversity decline through the reforestation of agricultural land(1). However, to achieve biodiversity co-benefits, carbon payments often require support from other policy mechanisms(2) such as regulation(3,4), targeting(5,6), and complementary incentives(7,8). We evaluated 14 policy mechanisms for supplying carbon and biodiversity co-benefits through reforestation of carbon plantings (CP) and environmental plantings (EP) in Australia's 85.3 Mha agricultural land under global change. The reference policy-uniform payments (bidders are paid the same price) with land-use competition (both CP and EP eligible for payments), targeting carbon-achieved significant carbon sequestration but negligible biodiversity co-benefits. Land-use regulation (only EP eligible) and two additional incentives complementing the reference policy (biodiversity premium, carbon levy) increased biodiversity co-benefits, but mostly inefficiently. Discriminatory payments (bidders are paid their bid price) with land-use competition were efficient, and with multifunctional targeting of both carbon and biodiversity co-benefits increased the biodiversity co-benefits almost 100-fold. Our findings were robust to uncertainty in global outlook, and to key agricultural productivity and land-use adoption assumptions. The results suggest clear policy directions, but careful mechanism design will be key to realising these efficiencies in practice. Choices remain for society about the amount of carbon and biodiversity co-benefits desired, and the price it is prepared to pay for them.",,Article,2016.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8866710066795349,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
629804,United States policy for mitigating global climate change,"The primary objective of this paper is to explain current U.S. policy on global climate change. U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) efforts to implement this policy will be described. A secondary objective of this paper is to discuss from a U.S. perspective the social and political efforts which must be initiated in order for ocean storage of CO2 to be considered as a viable CO2 mitigation option. The fact that the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) has not been successful in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is now recognized. Thus, U.S. policy has shifted towards the development of binding medium-term emissions targets and long-term atmosphere concentration goals. The U.S. believes these goals can be accomplished through the adoption of cost-effective joint implementation agreements and international emissions trading mechanisms. Studies are currently underway to assess specific targets and timetables for emissions reductions. Voluntary efforts on the part of U.S. industry have proven to be extremely successful in reducing U.S. CO2 emissions. The U.S. electric utility industry has taken the lead in voluntarily lowering greenhouse gas emissions under the DOE Climate Challenge Program. As of August, 1996, nearly 600 utility participants, accounting for over 60% of electric power generation in the U.S., have joined the program. Areas of research interest to DOE include the development of high efficiency advanced power generation cycles and CO2 sequestration technology. The U.S. currently spends $1.6 billion on understanding global climate phenomena and only $1.6 million on CO2 mitigation research. A number of socio-political considerations must be looked at in assessing the feasibility of ocean storage of CO2. Developing public trust appears to be a major concern in establishing the acceptability of ocean storage. Uncertainties in the effects of CO2 on marine life, potential safety hazards associated with pipelining, and ship transport of CO2 are all issues which must be dealt with as soon as possible.

These benefits are dependent on several soil functions that are affected in different ways by legislation from the European Union, national, and regional levels. We evaluated current European Union soil-related legislation and examples of regional legislation with regard to direct and indirect impacts on five soil functions: the production of food, fiber, and fuel; water purification and regulation; carbon sequestration and climate regulation; habitat for biodiversity provisioning; and the recycling of nutrients/agro-chemicals. Our results illustrate the diversity of existing policies and the complex interactions present between different spatial and temporal scales. The impact of most policies, positive or negative, on a soil function is usually not established, but depends on how the policy is implemented by local authorities and the farmers. This makes it difficult to estimate the overall state and trends of the different soil functions in agricultural ecosystems. To implement functional management and sustainable use of the different soil functions in agricultural ecosystems, more knowledge is needed on the policy interactions as well as on the impact of management options on the different soil functions.",soil function; European legislation; regional legislation; multifunctionality; soil policy,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.885248601436615,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1805487,Carbon Dioxide Removal Geoengineering,"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) geoengineering, the proposal to counteract anthropogenic climate change by large-scale removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, is playing an increasingly prominent role in the modelling that informs international climate change policy. Most of the modelling for the 1.5-2 degrees C temperature stabilisation targets of the Paris Agreement assumes that large-scale CDR will start by 2030 and be in full swing by 2050. The research, testing and development of CDR technologies needed to support these expectations pose significant challenges for international and domestic climate change law. Prominent examples of CDR proposals include bioenergy production with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and carbon sequestration by ocean fertilisation. Australia has vast land and marine estates so has a natural advantage to contribute to the research, field-testing and development and implementation of CDR. Despite this, there has been little analysis to date of how Australian law might govern CDR research, testing and development. Using case studies of BECCS and ocean fertilisation CDR techniques, this article examines the capacity of current Australian law to govern CDR research. We find that general environmental legislation might provide a basic governance framework for research and field-testing of BECCS and ocean fertilisation, but recommend that specific laws be developed if CDR is to play a prominent role in meeting Australia's international climate change commitments.",,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8850058913230896,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Non-carbon energy can now be made as affordable and accessible as fossil fuel, but tensions remain between measures to support sustainable development and measures to control climate change. Consequently, the distinction between subsistence energy and luxury energy continues to be surprisingly relevant to current international political struggles.

Critics argue that we should not rely on the promise of future NETs because that could be taken as an excuse to avoid decarbonization in the near term.

5342841,A Guide to International Climate Mitigation Policy and Finance Frameworks Relevant to the Protection and Restoration of Blue Carbon Ecosystems,"The protection, management and restoration of vegetated ecosystems on land and in the ocean (‘natural climate solutions’) can be a useful strategy for reducing net greenhouse gas emissions to help limit global warming. Their potential contribution to reducing net emissions has led to the development of policies and financial incentives for their protection and restoration. These have in turn created a set of expectations among some stakeholders, and interest in expanding these to encompass other ecosystems. However, there are specific rules about how abatement is calculated in international policy and climate finance, and the frameworks and terminology associated with them are often complex. This can be a barrier to stakeholders who want to leverage the potential of natural climate solutions, sometimes leading to incongruence between realised and anticipated benefits. In this article, we attempt to outline some of the key international policy and carbon market frameworks for coastal ‘blue carbon’ ecosystems, and the extent to which different ecosystems are accommodated. Currently, among the coastal ecosystems, only mangrove forests, seagrass meadows, and tidal marshes are typically considered in international policy and carbon market frameworks. The defining feature of these ecosystems is that the foundation species are plants that grow in sediment (soil). They are the only coastal ecosystems currently included in IPCC guidelines for national greenhouse gas inventories, and in compliance and voluntary carbon markets. There is interest in potentially including other marine ecosystems, such as kelp forests and unvegetated tidal flats, into carbon accounting frameworks, but there are unresolved questions about whether sequestration and storage of carbon by these ecosystems meets the rigorous standards required. Voluntary carbon markets have greater flexibility than mechanisms linked to national greenhouse gas inventories, and so might be early implementers of expanding methods to include other ecosystems. Incorporating coastal ecosystems into national greenhouse gas inventory is a useful action countries can take that will likely help generate incentives for protection and restoration of these important ecosystems.

575490,Carbon blinkers and policy blindness: The difficulties of 'Growing Our Woodland in Wales',"The need for climate change mitigation has led to a recent upsurge in policies aimed to deliver re-afforestation across the globe, but with mixed successes observed depending upon the levels of private land ownership and ability of governments to engage land managers. This paper evaluates a new government-led scheme in Wales, which is intended to increase woodland cover from 14% to 20% by 2030 to offset the greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. As the scheme is primarily intended to promote woodland creation on farms, the analysis of the paper focusses upon the question of how to incentivise farmers, and the reasons why difficulties have been experienced engaging land owners in the scheme. Whilst a number of recommendations are made from this policy evaluation, the paper also demonstrates that key lessons have not been applied from existing literature on farmers' behaviour and environmental scheme uptake, and that policy makers are not integrating practice across departmental divisions. As such, the paper suggests that the new focus on carbon sequestration has acted as a distraction to the development of a more robust governance strategy that builds on previous successes and failures in agri-environment policy.

All rules of governance affect-and only directly affect-human behavior, and through that behavior shape the biophysical world. All law is an expression of human culture. Legal statutes and rules are those elements of culture that we feel strongly enough about and share enough with each other that we write them down as rules of behavior and create some form of sanction for their transgression. In this paper I will discuss the broad-brush history of human value-based governance with respect to human use of the ocean and the kinds of decisions that face us with respect to the question of ocean fertilization. The general thesis is that ocean fertilization is essentially a 'cultivation' activity, even if done for the purpose of carbon sequestration for environmental conservation or market (carbon trading) purposes, and that such 'cultivation' is a new arena for ocean policy and regulation.",ocean fertilization; ocean policy; carbon sequestration,Review,2008.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8834947943687439,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
899996,Why Policymakers Should View Carbon Capture and Storage as a Stepping-stone to Carbon Dioxide Removal,"It is increasingly clear that atmospheric carbon dioxide removal will be necessary to limit global warming to below 2 degrees. Today the primary candidate to achieve this removal is bioenergy carbon capture and storage (CCS). Similarly, energy derived from coal with sufficiently low emissions for stringent climate change mitigation (i.e. clean coal) cannot be achieved without CCS. This article argues that the prior or simultaneous establishment of coal CCS provides an important stepping stone to the future diffusion of bioenergy CCS. However, progress on coal CCS is sluggish and needs further rationale to give it impetus. With appropriate policy intervention, the impending need for bioenergy CCS can provide this impetus. Policy makers should not consider coal CCS as simply an end in itself but also as a means to an end.",,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8834883570671082,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In the UK changes in government structure and privatisation of the electricity industry have led to the emergence of multi-level governance. This means that decisions on how to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from the electricity-generating sector should no longer be solely a national policy decision. Previous studies have sought to explore how renewable energy may develop under multi-level governance, but this paper pays attention to a traditional fossil fuel source, coal, which is still an important means of electricity generation. Coal is the most abundant fossil fuel and advocates argue that carbon capture and storage techniques could make coal 'clean', paving the way for a long-term, secure and low emission way to produce energy. This study focuses on the Yorkshire and Humber Region, which has had a long association with coal mining and looks at the implications of this as the region seeks to develop a climate change action plan and an energy strategy within the new regional governance structures. The paper argues that the regional networks developed to address climate change are influenced by existing social power structures and alliances.

By adopting an ecosystem approach, something that has become internationally advocated through the Convention on Biological Diversity, to understanding the objectives and sustainability of UK peatland management, this paper reviews contemporary policies relating to three broad categories of peatland ecosystem service (provisioning; regulating and cultural), developed at multiple levels (global to local).

399240,"Harnessing the climate mitigation, conservation and poverty alleviation potential of seagrasses: Prospects for developing blue carbon initiatives and payment for ecosystem service programmes","Seagrass ecosystems provide numerous ecosystem services that support coastal communities around the world. They sustain abundant marine life as well as commercial and artisanal fisheries, and help protect shorelines from coastal erosion. Additionally, seagrass meadows are a globally significant sink for carbon and represent a key ecosystem for combating climate change. However, seagrass habitats are suffering rapid global decline. Despite recognition of the importance of ""Blue Carbon,"" no functioning seagrass restoration or conservation projects supported by carbon finance currently operate, and the policies and frameworks to achieve this have not been developed. Yet, seagrass ecosystems could play a central role in addressing important international research questions regarding the natural mechanisms through which the ocean and the seabed can mitigate climate change, and how ecosystem structure links to service provision. The relative inattention that seagrass ecosystems have received represents both a serious oversight and a major missed opportunity. In this paper we review the prospects of further inclusion of seagrass ecosystems in climate policy frameworks, with a particular focus on carbon storage and sequestration, as well as the potential for developing payment for ecosystem service (PES) schemes that are complementary to carbon management. Prospects for the inclusion of seagrass Blue Carbon in regulatory compliance markets are currently limited; yet despite the risks the voluntary carbon sector offers the most immediately attractive avenue for the development of carbon credits. Given the array of ecosystem services seagrass ecosystems provide the most viable route to combat climate change, ensure seagrass conservation and improve livelihoods may be to complement any carbon payments with seagrass PES schemes based on the provision of additional ecosystem services. © 2015 Hejnowicz, Kennedy, Rudd and Huxham.",,Review,2015.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8830700516700745,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

5342769,Anticipatory Regulation: Lessons from fracking and insights for Greenhouse Gas Removal innovation and governance,"The UK has incorporated a net-zero emissions target into national legislation. A range of Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) options will likely play a key role in the government's strategy toward meeting this goal. Governance frameworks will need to be developed to support GGR development and manage the potential impacts, particularly those on the diverse local communities where the various options will be deployed. This research examines the UK's experience with development and regulation of shale gas - using the technologies of hydraulic fracturing combined with horizontal drilling - with a focus on governance and the implications for the development and widespread deployment of GGR. We evaluate the approach used against the principles of good governance, which emphasizes the critical role that local communities and publics play in deployment. The UK's top-down governance of shale gas highlights the risk of regulation driven by assumptions about national and local need, value and a lack of transparency or meaningful stakeholder participation in decision-making. The use of existing legislative frameworks for conventional fossil fuel extraction proved inadequate to address unanticipated consequences such as induced seismicity. Moreover, the support for unconventional hydrocarbons in UK energy policy appeared inconsistent with the goal of meeting greenhouse gas targets and passing significant legislation in 2019 to bring carbon emissions to net-zero. To gain social acceptance at the local level, deployment of new technologies needs to be evaluated from a variety of framings and viewpoints. Where new technologies or practices are deployed, such as fracking and GGR, the knowledge and understanding of the impacts - a fundamental principle of good governance - may be less certain or more contested. Early inclusion and participation of local communities would allow issues of concern to inform how trials are undertaken and regulation designed. This anticipatory and participatory approach fits with the principles of good governance and procedural justice, which can help build the trust needed to ensure social legitimacy leading to development and implementation of technological innovations. © 2022",,Article,2022.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8826436400413513,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

These two ETPs include hitherto missing 'key players' who can enhance commercial legitimacy on both the input and output sides of the system. This constitutes an important, though narrow, type of legitimacy in regard to specific technology developments, and questions remain about the performance of the ETPs in relation to small and medium-sized enterprises and social representation. This paper provides a valuable first qualitative analysis of this phenomenon which is emerging as a new policy instrument.",technology policy; innovation policy; innovation system; legitimacy; European Technology Platforms; industry,Article,2016.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8826051950454712,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
441,Reconciling environment and development in the clean development mechanism,"Providing a mechanism for financial transfers from the North to the South, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) aims to fund afforestation projects resulting in both reduced atmospheric carbon dioxide and sustainable development. One attractive feature of the CDM is that unlike other emerging carbon trading schemes it offers a means to promote sustainable development, which in a poor country must include providing poor people with income-earning opportunities. In practice however, the CDM projects may fail to address four issues key to this possibility: ownership, price, transaction costs, and use rights. The failure to address these issues ultimately could lead the CDMto benefit elite landowners at the expense of the poor. However, recognition of this oversight provides opportunities to work with poor communities worldwide to facilitate the collective action required to make the CDM work for them. Such a focus holds the key to ensuring that the CDM achieves the twin objectives of environmental conservation and sustainable development. Copyright © by The Haworth Press, Inc.

513524,Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage under the Clean Development Mechanism: Opportunities and Risks,"To mitigate the dangerous impacts of climate change, anthropogenic CO2 emissions must be reduced drastically. In this context, carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) has been increasingly considered as an option. As a part of the energy and climate change package, the EU has for the first time provided a comprehensive legal framework for the regulation of CCS at the national level. CCS can also be implemented under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol, which allows industrial countries to fulfil part of their emission reduction targets in developing countries. This paper explores this option, illustrating how elements of the legal framework proposed for CDM projects in the EU could be utilised, assuming CCS is approved for the CDM. Demonstration of large-scale feasibility and long-term security of storage is still lacking, however. The German Advisory Council on Environment therefore calls for a new law addressing research instead of comprehensive regulation of commercial use under the CCS directive of the EU. To nonetheless provide developing countries with access to CCS technology, promotion as part of technology transfer agreements is a possible alternative.",carbon dioxide capture and storage; CCS; Certified Emission Reductions; CDM; Clean Development Mechanism,Article,2009.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8822886347770691,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1726391,Between Mitigation and Adaptation: Geoengineering as a Progressive Approach to Climate Change,Prevention of possible negative impacts of climate change is now concentrating either on mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) or on adaptation (e.g. changes in landscape). Efficiency of both these policies are put in question in several studies. If consequences of climate change grow substantialy and mitigation and adaptation will not be sufficient an alternative strategy could occur. So called geoengineering focuses on intentional modification of the climate in order to reduce negative impacts on the environment and human societies.

5196828,European Carbon Dioxide Removal Policy: Current Status and Future Opportunities,"Over the past two years, the European Union, Norway, Iceland, and the UK have increased climate ambition and aggressively pushed forward an agenda to pursue climate neutrality or net-zero emissions by mid-century. This increased ambition, partly the result of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's landmark findings on limiting global warming to 1.5°C, has also led to a renewed approach to and revitalized debate about the role of carbon capture and storage and carbon dioxide removal. With increasing climate ambition, including a mid-century climate neutrality goal for the whole European Union, the potential role of technological carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is emerging as one of the critical points of debate among NGOs, policymakers, and the private sector. Policymakers are starting to discuss how to incentivize a CDR scale-up. What encompasses the current debate, and how does it relate to CDR technologies' expected role in reaching climate neutrality? This perspective will highlight that policy must fill two gaps: the accounting and the commercialization gap for the near-term development of a comprehensive CDR policy framework. It will shine a light on the current status of negative emission technologies and the role of carbon capture and storage in delivering negative emissions in Europe's decarbonized future. It will also analyze the role of carbon markets, including voluntary markets, as potential incentives while exploring policy pathways for a near-term scale-up.

5205307,Addressing power imbalances in biosequestration governance,"Climate change is a global challenge that requires strong governance on a global scale. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has suggested that large-scale biosequestration in the form of forest restoration or tree plantation establishment is a potential form of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) that could contribute significantly to climate change mitigation. Yet it has also cautioned that this approach has social and environmental trade-offs that need to be addressed through enhanced land governance. Land governance, per definition, has a strong local dimension as most lands are inhabited by local communities. Glocal and other multi-scale governance approaches have been proposed to address potential conflicts between global policies and the rights, needs and priorities of local communities. Yet these approaches often overlook the power imbalances between the actors that design global climate policies and the local, often politically and economically marginalized, indigenous and other forest-dependent communities that are directly impacted by these policies. The paper will explore to what extent theoretical concepts like rights-based approaches have been able to address these conflicts and power imbalances, and whether more profound changes in governance systems are required to ensure equitable implementation of CDR.",,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8812372088432312,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5196881,Who Is Paying for Carbon Dioxide Removal? Designing Policy Instruments for Mobilizing Negative Emissions Technologies,"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) poses a significant and complex public policy challenge in the long-term. Presently treated as a marginal aspect of climate policy, addressing CDR as a public good is quickly becoming essential for limiting warming to well below 2 or 1.5°C by achieving net-zero emissions in time – including by mobilization of public and private finance. In this policy and practice review, we develop six functions jointly needed for policy mixes mobilizing CDR in a manner compatible with the Paris Agreement's objectives. We discuss the emerging CDR financing efforts in light of these functions, and we chart a path to a meaningful long-term structuring of policies and financing instruments. CDR characteristics point to the need for up-front capital, continuous funding for scaling, and long-term operating funding streams, as well as differentiation based on permanence of storage and should influence the design of policy instruments. Transparency and early public deliberation are essential for charting a politically stable course of action on CDR, while specific policy designs are being developed in a way that ensures effectiveness, prevents rent-seeking at public expense, and allows for iterative course corrections. We propose a stepwise approach whereby various CDR approaches initially need differentiated treatment based on their differing maturity and cost through R&D pilot activity subsidies. In the longer term, CDR increasingly ought to be funded through mitigation results-oriented financing and included in broader policy instruments. We conclude that CDR needs to become a regularly-provided public service like public waste management has become over the last century.

857491,INDC costs and experiences in removing low-carbon technology barriers: Australia,"Australia's emissions increased in recent years and are projected to continue. The increase has been driven by land clearing, increased coal mining, and increased production of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG). The electricity sector is the major contributor to the total emissions. Coal has been and continues to be a major source of low-cost energy and foreign income source. Nevertheless, Australia's renewable energy resources have the potential to meet the total energy requirements of the country. Hydroenergy is the largest source of renewable energy used for electricity generation. Government policies, both at the Federal and State levels, have increased the use of wind and solar power in recent years. Despite this, Australia's electricity supply will remain dominated by fossil fuels. Australian Government energy policy has been to keep a balance between environmental and economic concerns. There are efforts being made to reduce emissions from coal and gas using carbon capture and storage (CCS). There are some impediments to Australia's increasing the renewable energy supply in the short-to-medium terms.

726540,Dual-function forests in the returning farmland to forest program and the flexibility of environmental policy in China,"The Returning Farmland to Forest Program (RFFP; tuigeng huanlin gongcheng), which compensates farmers for cultivating forest on previously non-forested land, is central among the ""ecological construction"" programs that have transformed landscapes across China. Under the RFFP, state authorities have redefined large areas of land as afforestation area intended to provide environmental services including erosion control, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity regeneration. Tensions among the program's social and environmental objectives as well as the combination of formal rigidity and practical flexibility manifest in ambiguous forest classifications and tremendous variation in outcomes. The RFFP centers on two forest categorizations: ecological forest, intended to rehabilitate environmental services, and commercial forest, which may provide lesser ecological benefits but delivers more immediate economic benefits to households. RFFP policy documents designate ""dual-function species"" that can be planted as ""forests with a primary goal of ecological service provision which also generate commercial value."" A substantial portion of ""ecological forests"" are dual landscapes intended to accomplish both environmental and socioeconomic goals. Drawing from cases in Yunnan, Sichuan, and Hainan provinces, this paper examines the processes of central policy-making and local implementation through which dual-function forests have proliferated, showing how rural residents have responded to the risks and promises of dual-function forests and exploring implications for rural livelihoods and landscapes. While they might be expected to bring win-win outcomes, the performance of dual-function forests on social and environmental goals depends on how local officials and residents respond to the program. Their proliferation demonstrates tensions inherent in state projects aimed at generating both environmental and economic values from rural landscapes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Much of this influence, this article argues, has come from China forging a path for climate adaptation and mitigation for the global South. This is having far-reaching consequences, the article further argues, for the politics of global climate governance. China's discursive and diplomatic power in climate politics is growing as China builds alliances across the global South. China is leveraging this enhanced soft power to elevate the importance of adaptation in multilateral climate negotiations, advance a technocentric approach to climate mitigation, export its development model, and promote industrial-scale afforestation as a nature-based climate solution. China's strategy is enhancing climate financing, technology transfers, renewable power, and adaptation infrastructure across the global South. To some extent, this is helping with a transition to a low-carbon world economy. Yet China's leadership is also reinforcing incremental, technocratic, and growth-oriented solutions in global climate governance. These findings advance the understanding of China's role in global environmental politics, especially its growing influence on climate governance in the global South. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,2022.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8800852298736572,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

4382772,Targeted policy proposals for managing spontaneous forest expansion in the Mediterranean,"Recent forest expansion in Euro-Mediterranean countries predominantly results from secondary succession in abandoned farmland, rather than from artificial afforestation. This major forest transition involves the delivery of both ecosystem services and disservices, which must be balanced through new land-use planning and policy approaches. Ecosystem services arising from this expansion of forests include increased carbon sequestration, water infiltration, provision of forest products, soil retention and forest coalescence. Nevertheless, ecosystem disservices such as reductions in water yield, landscape homogenisation, increased wildfire risk and/or the loss of high nature value managed habitats caution against generalisation of the benefits of such expansion. Most EU funds related to forests are being allocated to conservation, restoration, or fire prevention and extinction efforts, whereas sustainable forest management and the maintenance of multifunctional agro-silvo-pastoral mosaics are hampered by the lack of financial incentives and by environmental regulations. Policy implications. We advocate for more-targeted policies based on landscape planning that favours multifunctionality while reducing environmental and economic uncertainties and maximising the ecosystem service/disservice ratio. The following recommendations follow from this approach: (a) a climate-smart policy favouring fire-resistant landscapes and enhancing value chains that stimulate active forest management; (b) the adoption of a territorial perspective, beyond forest and farm-based measures and payments, that relies on management actions and minimises socio-ecological tensions; (c) refocusing CAP Pillar II grants from afforestation and forest protection measures to sustainable forest management; (d) transforming the CAP direct payments to support multifunctional farming systems (e.g. agroforestry); (e) a more balanced inclusion of different land uses in the Natura 2000 network and intensification of the support for High Nature Value farming in less-favoured areas.",ecosystem disservices; ecosystem services; forest expansion; Mediterranean forest; mosaic landscapes; multifunctionality&#8208; oriented policy; wildfire risk,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8797982335090637,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

We consider how developments within and between these “frontiers” could result in different futures—where hype and over-promising around marine carbon drawdown could enable continued time-buying for the carbon economy without providing significant removals, or where reforms to modeling practices, policy development, innovation funding, and legal governance could seek co-benefits between ocean protection, economy, and climate.

646213,Cost-effective policy instruments for greenhouse gas emission reduction and fossil fuel substitution through bioenergy production in Austria,"Climate change mitigation and security of energy supply are important targets of Austrian energy policy. Bioenergy production based on resources from agriculture and forestry is an important option for attaining these targets. To increase the share of bioenergy in the energy supply, supporting policy instruments are necessary. The cost-effectiveness of these instruments in attaining policy targets depends on the availability of bioenergy technologies. Advanced technologies such as second-generation biofuels, biomass gasification for power production, and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) will likely change the performance of policy instruments. This article assesses the cost-effectiveness of energy policy instruments, considering new bioenergy technologies for the year 2030, with respect to greenhouse gas emission (GHG) reduction and fossil fuel substitution. Instruments that directly subsidize bioenergy are compared with instruments that aim at reducing GHG emissions. A spatially explicit modeling approach is used to account for biomass supply and energy distribution costs in Austria. Results indicate that a carbon tax performs cost-effectively with respect to both policy targets if BECCS is not available. However, the availability of BECCS creates a trade-off between GHG emission reduction and fossil fuel substitution. Biofuel blending obligations are costly in terms of attaining the policy targets.

61531,The perspectives and barriers for the implementation of CCS in Poland,"Over 90% of Polish energy comes from burning fossil fuels, i.e., hard coal and lignite, responsible for high greenhouse gas (including CO2) emissions. The need to adapt to international agreements, expected increase of CO2 emissions, limited technological capabilities to reduce emissions, the energy intensity of industry and geological conditions allowing underground storage make carbon capture and storage (CCS) a viable option to reduce CO2 emissions. The implementation of CCS on a commercial scale depends on many factors, including the development of capture technology, transport options, and the geological structure. Its applicability is highly dependent on the regulations and economic, energy, and environmental policy. At the current stage of work, the biggest problems in the implementation of CCS include legal regulations, social acceptance, and cost reduction. The numerous political and economic benefits may balance the costs of CCS technology implementation. The captured CO2 can be used in the exploitation of oil fields and in large-scale industrial processes. The implementation of CCS can contribute to the introduction of high-efficient technologies and modernization of the national energy sector. The development of CCS can help to create new jobs, stimulate the development of the Polish economy and contribute to the development of research in this field.

4372353,Progressive supply-side policy under the Paris Agreement to enhance geological carbon storage,"As the Paris Agreement moves towards implementation, we explore opportunities it presents to move part of the climate change mitigation challenge upstream into supply-side climate policy. Supply-side climate policies have been sparsely employed to date, although interest is growing in approaches that can curtail and end fossil fuel production. Rather than focussing on fully eliminating fossil fuel production, we set out an alternative supply-side approach that involves fossil fuel producers taking progressive action to reduce and eliminate the climate impacts of their products. Our proposal uses the Paris Agreement's framework for finance and international cooperation to establish supply-side climate action that supplements demand-side climate policies, and thereby enhance climate ambition. The concepts presented rely on large-scale geosequestration technologies that can deposit carbon into geological reservoirs at rates progressively aligned to those at which carbon is being extracted by fossil fuel producers. Convergence of extraction and deposition rates is a necessary condition for achieving net-zero CO(2)emissions while still enabling some essential uses of fossil carbon. We propose an evolutionary approach to policy development, starting as a technology-support mechanism using results-based finance before transitioning into systematic measures under, firstly, Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, and, ultimately, decarbonised fuel standards. Collectively these could incentivise fossil fuel resource holders to manage both outflows and inflows of carbon in the geosphere, and in doing so, create, foster, accelerate and maintain an urgently needed market for geological CO(2)storage. Key policy insights Balancing rates of carbon extraction from the geosphere (e.g. fossil fuel production) and rates of carbon deposition in stable geological reservoirs can achieve net-zero emissions alongside efforts to reduce emission flows to the atmosphere. Framing the climate mitigation challenge around carbon stock management on the supply-side of fossil fuel markets offers new ways to enhance climate ambition by mobilizing the financial and technical resources of fossil fuel producers in deploying carbon capture and storage.

The Kyoto Protocol, and the agreements achieved in the following process negotiation, have defined the LULUCF activities (land use, land use change, forestry) the industrialized countries have at disposal to reach the engagements of reduction of the climate emissions-changing. The CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) reform affirmed that the content of the policy will secure a multifunctional, sustainable and competitive agriculture throughout Europe. It will also be able to maintain the landscape and the countryside, make a key contribution to the vitality of rural communities and respond to consumer concerns and demands regarding food quality and safety, environmental protection and maintaining animal welfare standards. In regulation absence firms pollute into air CO2 without being held to pay a price of the service of assimilation of the greenhouse gases supplied from the agroforestry sector. The greater social efficiency of taxes than adopting reduction standard (as signed in the Kyoto Protocol) is demonstrated. In spite of that, the society has no general agreement on supporting farmers and the overcoming of practical problems following this policy remain as a narrow road.

The role played by the domestic resources and especially by coal is increasingly becoming the focus of the EU energy strategy. There is a strong pressure for the decarbonization of the energy mix. The emission trading scheme (ETS) can have an impact on the shift to lower carbon-intensive fuels. The impact of ETS on coal can be important, because it is very short-sighted and only defines the period LIP to 2008-2012. The ETS carbon dioxide (CO2) regime must ensure that investments in coal-fired plants in the long term are supported. EU Research Institutes and Coal Industry identified an important CO2 reduction potential by improving the efficiency of the conversion of solid fuels into electricity. Highly efficient clean coal technologies can contribute to reasonable costs and challenge the issue of climate change. It must be pointed out that the EU Energy Policy should now concentrate on the necessity to effectively support demonstration projects and to create the legal framework for the integrated approach of efficiency enhancement and CO2 capture and storage (CCS). However, it is not a proper and rational approach to implement CCS before the technology is demonstrated and before it is clear that it will be commercially viable. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

725426,Local implementation of global climate change commitments,"More than 400 U.S. municipalities have committed to addressing climate change by reducing their contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. Through the U.S. Mayors Climate Protection Agreement and the Cities for Climate Protection ™ program, mayors and local government officials from all political parties and in all 50 states have made commitments to address global climate change in an effort to improve quality of life for citizens as well as curb pollution at the local level. These high level commitments by elected officials are beginning to influence engineering and operations decisions by public managers, including urban planners, environmental officials, and public works and utility directors and this trend will only continue to rise. This paper will explore the implementation of these commitments and the implications for air and waste management for local governments. Policy and market drivers, including upcoming legislation and greenhouse gas registries, will be presented to lay the foundation for the local policy commitments. Examples are provided to demonstrate how local governments can make a difference by reducing greenhouse gas emissions for the facilities they manage. These will include: greenhouse gas management plans for wastewater and water treatment plants including methane digesters, landfill gas capture and cogeneration, and carbon sequestration through urban tree planting.",,Conference Paper,2007.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8763947486877441,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
1035601,Low-ILUC biofuel production in marginal areas: Can existing EU policies support biochar deployment in EU MED arid lands under desertification?,"Arid lands in EU MED areas are increasing in extension year by year, as it is well documented by many studies of International Institutions (as EC-JRC, EEA, etc). EU MED farmers face the dramatic effects of extended drought conditions, that combined with extreme phenomena as floodings or thunderstorms make economic profitability of agriculture very low or even negative. This is associated with a clearly increasing abandonment rate of agricultural land in EU. The most EU critical areas are located in Spain, but also Greece, Italy and Portugal, as well as in the non-EU Southern rim of the MED basin. Biochar could represent an effective approach to fight desertification, together with other agronomic practices which can vary depending on the specific location or crops. Biochar can be cheaply produced from residual biomass through processes such as slow pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization, and its combination with compost obtained from the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) or digestate from anaerobic digestion can offer both a short and a medium-to-long term effect in dryland agriculture. These lands, that otherwise would inevitably leave the active utilisation in conventional agriculture, would be suitable for energy crop cultivation, as drought resistant oil crop, well meeting the latest indications in the EC REDII proposal. Through biochar (and derived product) application, the loss of Utilised Agricultural Land in EU MED drylands can be prevented. From the policy side, it thus makes sense to investigate if existing policies are sufficient to facilitate the wide market deployment of biochar, or if new instruments are needed. Our analysis demonstrates that currently operational EU policies, could be well used to implement biochar related actions in arid lands. However, most often these measures are not transferred into concrete programmes at regional level, especially in the agricultural sector. In fact, EU and Member States already have quite a large number of instruments that can directly or indirectly support actions targeted to increase the resilience of these arid lands to Climate Change, generating a significant impact on the environmental and socio-economic situation. Policy should support initiatives that can provide clear evidences, be cost- and environmentally-effective, and adapted to local conditions. The present work investigated EU/MS policies that could potentially support the improvement of soil resilience to climate change in EU MED region, by enabling widespread diffusion of biochar. The EU legislative elements that were considered are the EU agricultural policy, the EU Carbon sequestration & storage policy (seen in the framework of the COP21 agreement and its core goals), and the EU renewable energy policy, even if others would also apply. We considered sunflower cultivation in dry land of Central area (Tuscany) of Italy. Results showed that marginal land could be seen as an opportunity to produce low-ILUC biofuels (as mentioned in the EC REDII proposed Directive), without conflicting with food production or generating negative effects on GHG emissions. The Long-term storage of C in the soil through biochar would perfectly match with the Climate strategy defined at International level (Paris COP21 and following). Soil, after ocean, is the second most abundant C sink: Paris-COP21 called for C-negative actions (and not just C-neutral ones). In this respect, the proposed approach would perfectly match with EU (ETS) and International (COP21) policy for the coming decades.

5283913,A joint climate and nature cure: A transformative change perspective,"Climate change has considerably dominated science-policy dialogue, public debate, and subsequently environmental policies since the three ""Rio Conventions"" were born. This has led to practically independent courses of action of climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation actions, neglecting potential conflicts among outcomes and with missed opportunities for synergistic measures. Transformative governance principles have been proposed to overcome these limitations. Using a transformative governance lens, we use the case of the Norwegian ""Climate Cure 2030"" for the Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) sector to, first, illustrate the mechanisms that have led to the choice of climate mitigation measures; second, to analyze the potential consequences of these measures on biodiversity and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; and, third, to evaluate alternative measures with potential positive outcomes for biodiversity and GHG emissions/removals.

459329,Implementing REDD plus at the national level: Stakeholder engagement and policy coherences between REDD plus rules and Kenya's sectoral policies,"Effective implementation of rules on reduced emission from avoided deforestation and forest degradation (REDD +) depends on the compatibility between these rules and existing sectoral policies associated with forests. This paper applies content analysis of policy documents, semi-structured interviews and case study analysis to examine the interplay between REDD + rules and Kenyan sectorial policies and local socioeconomic settings. Results reveal that the preparation of national REDD + strategies in Kenya is usefully coordinated by the Kenyan forestry sector drawing on the sector's policy mandate and past experiences in forest management. This sectoral mainstreaming however degenerates into negative vertical policy interplay caused by poor consultations with key sectors outside the forestry sector e.g. lands and agriculture and is further exacerbated by sectoral competition for climate finance. Analysis of REDD + coherences with sectoral policies revealed that forest polices on reforestation and decentralisation are coherent with REDD+ rules (horizontal interplay) but this coherence is impeded by limited implementation of these measures e.g. poor support and coordination of Community Forest Associations. Lack of coherence was mainly observed between REDD+ rules and resettlement and agricultural mechanisation policies prescribed in the lands and agriculture policies. Agricultural mechanisation and resettlement policies are synonymous with deforestation especially through illegal and politically motivated agricultural or settlement expansions into Kenya's forest areas. At the local level, REDD + showed potential to positively influence local livelihoods but the aforementioned national institutional gaps and strict carbon standards and prices lead to negative trade-offs between carbon sequestration and alternative livelihoods. The paper advocates for strong multi-stakeholder consultative mechanism so that both Kenyan policy and socioeconomic settings can support effective REDD+ implementation. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

2090824,Securing the climate benefits of stable forests,"Stable forests - those not already significantly disturbed nor facing predictable near-future risks of anthropogenic disturbance - may play a large role in the climate solution, due to their carbon sequestration and storage capabilities. Their importance is recognized by the Paris Agreement, but stable forests have received comparatively little attention through existing forest protection mechanisms and finance. Instead, emphasis has been placed on targeting locations where deforestation and forest degradation are happening actively. Yet stopping deforestation and forest degradation does not guarantee durable success, especially outside the geographic scope of targeted efforts. As a result, today'sstable forests may be at risk without additional efforts to secure their long-term conservation. We synthesize the gaps in existing policy efforts that could address the climate-related benefits derived from stable forests, noting several barriers to action, such as uncertainty around the level of climate services that stable forests provide and difficulties describing the real level of threat posed. We argue that resource and finance allocation for stable forests should be incorporated into countries' and donors' comprehensive portfolios aimed at tackling deforestation and forest degradation as well as resulting emissions. A holistic and forward-looking approach will be particularly important, given that success in tackling deforestation and forest degradation where it is currently happening will need to be sustained in the long term.Key policy insights Climate policies, finance, and implementation have tended to focus on areas of recent forest loss and near-term threats of anthropogenic disturbance, resulting in an imbalance of effort that fails to adequately address stable forests. In some contexts, policy measuresintended to secure the climate-related benefits of stable forests have competed poorly against more urgent threats. Policymakers and finance mechanisms should view stable forests as a complementary element within a holistic, long-term approach to resource management. International mechanisms and national frameworks should be adjusted and resourced to promote the long-term sustainability and permanence of stable forests. Beyond additional resources, the climate benefits of stable forests may be best secured by pro-actively designing implementing policies that recognize the rights and interests of stakeholders who are affected by land managementdecisions.",Stable forests; climate services; incentives gap; Consolidation; long-term conservation,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8750777244567871,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
353150,President Obama's climate action plan,"On June 25, 2013, President Obama announced a Climate Action Plan (CAP) to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases (GHG), and to encourage adaptation to expected climate change. The President affirmed his 2009 pledge to reduce U.S. GHG emissions by 17% below 2005 levels by 2020 if all other major economies agreed to limit their emissions as well. In 2012, U.S. gross GHG emissions were approximately 10% below 2005 levels. The President stated willingness to work with Congress toward enacting a bipartisan, market-based scheme to reduce GHG emissions. He also said that he would take executive branch actions in the absence of congressional support. His CAP identifies measures in three categories: • Cut carbon pollution in America. • Prepare the United States for the impacts of climate change. • Lead international efforts to address global climate change. Many measures in the CAP have been under way. The plan specifies few timelines or metrics for evaluating progress of individual measures. A Presidential Memorandum, also of June 25, 2014, directs the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to issue two rules to curtail CO2 emissions from new and existing power plants. First, it instructs EPA to re-propose standards under the Clean Air Act (CAA) for GHG emissions from newly constructed electric generating units (EGU), and to issue the final rule ""in a timely fashion"" after comments. This proposal was published in the Federal Register on January 8, 2014, opening a 60-day comment period. Second, and more significantly, the Memorandum directs EPA to issue standards, regulations, or guidelines for CO2 emissions applicable to modified, reconstructed, and existing power plants, building on states' efforts to reduce power plant emissions. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy plans to announce the proposed guidelines for existing EGU on June 2, 2014. The Memorandum requests rules to be finalized by June 1, 2015. Further, it requests that guidelines require states to submit to EPA their implementation plans, required under Section 111(d) of the CAA, and their implementing regulations by June 30, 2016. Many stakeholders have encouraged EPA to write the standards and guidelines to allow innovative, potentially cost-cutting flexibilities to states and regulated entities. The CAP additionally announces regulatory actions to • reduce GHG emissions including fuel efficiency standards for heavy-duty vehicles post-2018; • tighten efficiency standards for federal buildings; and • require a transition away from chemicals that contribute to global climate change that were introduced as alternatives to stratospheric ozone-depleting chemicals. President Obama referred to the pending Presidential Permit for the Keystone XL pipeline to carry Canadian oil sands across the U.S. border: ""The net effects of the pipeline's impact on our climate will be absolutely critical to determining whether this project is allowed to go forward."" In early 2014, the White House announced a strategy to reduce methane, about 9% of U.S. GHG emissions. Additional administrative actions would promote energy efficiency and increased electricity generation by renewable energy in federal facilities, on federal lands, and by private, state, and local partners of federal agencies. The President's FY2015 budget proposed funding for some related actions. To promote adaptation to climate change by the federal government and states and localities, the CAP mostly continues existing programs. Executive Order 13653, issued November 1, 2013, Preparing the United States for the Impacts of Climate Change, expounds on efforts federal agencies should undertake to enhance climate preparedness and resilience. The CAP includes international initiatives to promote global reductions of GHG emissions and adaptation. One would end U.S. support for public financing of new coal-fired power plants overseas, except those employing advanced efficiency or carbon capture and sequestration technology. Notably, the CAP does not quantify whether it would meet the President's commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 17% from 2005 levels by 2020. Nor does it say how the United States would produce its share of a 2009 international pledge of $100 billion annually to assist developing countries to mitigate GHG emissions and adapt to climate change. © 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

2595,Legal and Regulatory Developments on CCS,"Since IPCC Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (IPCC, 2005) was published there have been significant developments in international, regional and national law and regulations. The Special Report, being written in 2003-2005, reflected the relatively early nature of development of regulations pertaining to CCS and, in particular, geologic storage. The principle area of focus in the Special Report was marine treaties - namely the Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR) and the London Convention - as they had been the focus of prior legal analysis and the parties to the treaties had begun their own consideration of the topic. Both marine treaties proceeded to remove their prohibitions on CO2 geological storage, the London Convention in 2006 and OSPAR in 2007 (IMO, 2006a; OSPAR, 2007c). Another significant influence at this time was the work being undertaken to develop a CCS-focused chapter in the IPCC Guidelines for GHG Inventories (IPCC, 2006a). These guidelines set out how to undertake and report the GHG performance of CCS, creating a methodology for geological storage assessment and report that became the basis for subsequent CCS regulations. In the years following, there were numerous developments at the national and regional levels. For example, the EU CCS Directive was developed in 2007 and 2008 (EC, 2009a), to create an enabling framework for CCS, to remove barriers and allow it to proceed but also to ensure environmental protection. The Directive was adopted in 2009, along with a revision of the EU's Emission Trading Directive (EC, 2009a) which brought CCS into the EU's emissions trading scheme. CCS-specific laws and regulations have also been established at both the federal and state levels in the United States, and the commonwealth and state levels in Australia. The other major development in international law and regulations since the Special Report is the inclusion of CCS into the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) under the UNFCCC's Kyoto Protocol. This took several years, from 2005 to 2011, but in 2011 a new set of rules specific to CCS were developed and adopted which allows CCS to be a legitimate project activity under the CDM for developing countries to use (UNFCCC, 2011b). It is widely anticipated that future mechanisms developed under the UNFCCC and allowing CCS will follow the principles established by these CCS CDM modalities and procedures. These international developments potentially impact 180 countries. This paper provides a descriptive review of the key legal and regulatory developments since 2005, with a particular focus on the international developments. It also briefly reviews the application of permitting regimes to new CCS projects in the US and EU (Netherlands). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

688931,Smoke and Mirrors: Some Reflections on the Science and Politics of Geoengineering,"This article identifies and explores some of the political issues that will need to be addressed in the governance of geoengineering. It is argued that the diversity of different possible geoengineering techniques-encompassing solar radiation management (SRM) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR), and further divided into territorial techniques and commons-based techniques-rules out a single mode of geoengineering governance. Whereas some geoengineering techniques may be effective when implemented by a small number of countries, others would need to be implemented around the globe and involve most countries of the world, with different countries having different comparative advantages in the various geoengineering techniques. Such an enterprise would generate collective action problems related to implementation and disagreements over who should pay for the financial and nonfinancial costs of geoengineering. Nonetheless, a more coherent system of geoengineering governance is possible and is necessary if international conflict is to be avoided and the risks of unintended consequences are to be minimized. Any new international institutional design on geoengineering will need to address some pressing political and scientific questions, including the desired mean temperature of the world's climate, the possible role of CDR technologies in carbon offsets and emissions-trading schemes, and whether there should be differentiated obligations between different groups of states.",carbon dioxide removal; geoengineering; global commons; governance; risk; solar radiation management,Article,2011.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8746677041053772,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

There is justifiable concern that ocean fertilisation, for the purpose of climate change mitigation, risks undermining marine protection. Ocean fertilisation activity is currently limited, through resolutions under the Convention for Biological Diversity and the London Convention and recent amendments of the London Protocol, to small-scale scientific research studies within coastal waters. This article seeks to respond to the question of 'what next?' for international regulation of ocean fertilisation, including an examination of how a recent agreement to amend the London Protocol may be implemented in domestic law, as well as how carbon markets might work to ensure the effectiveness of ocean fertilisation activities. The article first provides an overview of the risks, effectiveness and costs of ocean fertilisation, as well as a glance at the two key trials undertaken.

Here we explore the political dimensions and policy implications of expectations for ""negative emissions"" in the European Union (EU), considering its largely successful leadership role in mitigation action and corresponding low-carbon technology development and deployment. Carbon dioxide removal and especially Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage present significant challenges to the EU's dominant climate policy paradigm and low-carbon policy experience. Considering this challenge, we assess expectations for widespread implementation of carbon dioxide removal in the EU to be unrealistic, and explore possible pathways for its more limited introduction.

To meet this goal, the international community will have to aggressively reduce emissions and also remove CO2 from the atmosphere on an unprecedented scale, through an array of biological and technical Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) options. This paper considers governance challenges that arise from the need to rely on CDR to meet the Paris Agreement's long-term temperature goal. It looks at how heavy this reliance may have to be, over what timeframe, involving what options and, crucially, how best to ensure that CDR does not, while trying to address one problem, create many other challenges for sustainable development. After identifying the potential scale and pace of CO2 removal needed to meet the 1.5 degrees C goal, we identify key governance gaps and challenges that arise from large-scale CDR implementation and propose a series of policy responses to be addressed by policy makers as a matter of priority, to enable CDR to contribute to 1.5 degrees C-consistent pathways at the scale and pace required.",,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8738413453102112,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The European Member states are obliged to transpose the directive in their national legislations no later than 25 June 2011. The EU legislator has applied a regime of minimum harmonisation when drafting the CCS Directive, amongst others to achieve that an agreement could be reached on the CCS Directive by a majority of Member States. In other words; Member States have considerable discretionary powers while implementing the Directive. The CO2 Storage Directive is mainly transposed into Dutch legislation by means of adaptation of the Dutch Mining Act. There are, however, still some issues in the implementation of this directive that need further clarification. The way these issues are addressed may impact the deployment of large-scale CO2 capture and storage (CCS) in the Netherlands and Europe.

4350069,A Precautionary Assessment of Systemic Projections and Promises From Sunlight Reflection and Carbon Removal Modeling,"Climate change is a paradigmatic example of systemic risk. Recently, proposals for large-scale interventions-carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM)-have started to redefine climate governance strategies. We describe how evolving modeling practices are trending toward optimized and ""best-case""projections-portraying deployment schemes that create both technically slanted and politically sanitized profiles of risk, as well as ideal objectives for CDR and SRM as mitigation-enhancing, time-buying mechanisms for carbon transitions or vulnerable populations. Aspromises, stylized and hopeful projections may selectively reinforce industry and political activities built around the inertia of the carbon economy. Some evidence suggests this is the emerging case for certain kinds of CDR, where the prospect of future carbon capture substitutes for present mitigation. Either of these implications are systemic: explorations of climatic futures may entrench certain carbon infrastructures. We point out efforts and recommendations to forestall this trend in the implementation of the Paris Agreement, by creating more stakeholder input and strengthening political realism in modeling and other assessments, as well as through policy guardrails.",Carbon dioxide removal; modeling projections; precautionary measures; solar radiation management; systemic risk,Article,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8733417987823486,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
471960,Joining the CCS club! The economics of CO2 pipeline projects,"This paper examines the conditions for a widespread adoption of Carbon Capture transport and Storage (CCS) by a group of emitters that can be connected to a common CO2 pipeline. It details a modeling framework aimed at assessing the critical value in the charge for the CO2 emissions required for each of the emitters to decide to implement capture capabilities. This model can be used to analyze how the tariff structure imposed on the CO2 pipeline operator modifies the overall cost of CO2 abatement via CCS. This framework is applied to the case of a real European CO2 pipeline project. We find that the obligation to use cross-subsidy-free pipeline tariffs has a minor impact on the minimum CO2 price required to adopt the CCS. In contrast, the obligation to charge non-discriminatory prices can either impede the adoption of CCS or significantly raise that price. Besides which, we compared two alternative regulatory frameworks for CO2 pipelines: a common European organization as opposed to a collection of national regulations. The results indicate that the institutional scope of that regulation has a limited impact on the adoption of CCS compared to the detailed design of the tariff structure imposed on pipeline operators.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can, in combination with several other mitigation technologies, alleviate global warming by reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Reducing climate change-related risks via CCS creates another risk, smaller in extent: the risk that some of the stored CO2 leaks out of the storage complex. This article reviews European legislation and evaluates how one of its objectives, that private liabilities of CCS-related leakage risks are not socialized, is ensured. Slight modifications of European legislation are suggested in order to prevent an indefinite liability of CCS operators in case a storage complex turns out to be unexpectedly and unavoidably prone to CO2 leakages. Official German and Hungarian financial precaution specifications are contrasted and related to this article's finding that the state budget is sufficiently hedged against the expected value of climate-related leakage compensation costs of poorly managed storage complexes if 3 to 6% of a CCS operator's emission-related revenues are diverted into a financial precaution fund.",Precautionary principle; Carbon dioxide leakage; CCS Directive; Directive 2009; 31; EC; Financial security; Transfer of responsibility,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8733315467834473,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
568952,Current European policies are unlikely to jointly foster carbon sequestration and protect biodiversity,"The extension of forest area is a globally accepted tool to offset CO2 emissions from deforestation and the combustion of fossil fuels. The common assumption is that in addition to the perceived climate benefits increasing forest area will also support biodiversity, thus making afforestation a ""win-win scenario"". Based on the existing scientific evidences, we show that joined climate and biodiversity benefits are strongly context-dependent and that the outcome of afforestation is often highly questionable. In Europe, grasslands managed at low intensity contribute substantially to biodiversity conservation and carbon storage. However, many of these grasslands have been lost due to abandonment and subsequent spontaneous succession towards woody vegetation, or due to land use intensification. Moreover, grasslands are the ecosystems most often deliberately afforested in the context of EU carbon-centered policies that may thus counteract biodiversity conservation programmes. By reviewing the main EU policies targeting forests and grasslands, we found a striking ambivalence between policies and funding schemes addressing grassland conservation on the one hand (e.g. Habitats Directive, green payments within the Common Agricultural Policy) and those supporting afforestation on the other (e.g. rural development funds). We suggest three measures towards a better harmonization of the European Union policies that target forest and grassland ecosystems: (1) promoting the alignment of the decisions taken across different policy sectors; (2) focusing on the whole range of ecosystem services and biodiversity issues rather than on carbon management only; (3) valuing systems managed at low-intensity for their multifunctionality.

Together, the nations within and surrounding this ocean basin contain approximately 50% (an estimated 76,275 km(2)) of the world's mangrove forests and a large, but unknown, proportion of its seagrass meadows. The nations of the Indian Ocean have an opportunity to be world leaders in restoration and protection of these ecosystems, which can help mitigate climate change, enhance livelihoods and protect shorelines from erosion and storm damage. Already, Indian Ocean nations are showing leadership by acknowledging blue carbon ecosystems in their Nationally Determined Contributions, and by championing efforts to establish some of the largest blue carbon restoration projects globally. However, more can be done.

A closer look at the globally most important emission sectors-power, transport and industry-shows manifold barriers for very ambitious mitigation. A new policy guideline called ""Net Zero CO2 Emissions without relying on massive CDR"" and promotion of technological research, in addition to economic incentives and other policy measures, would help to overcome the often simplistic demands for positive modelling results and refocus climate policy on tackling the enormous barriers in key emitting sectors. Such an approach is more aligned with the Paris Agreement's bottom-up logic and therefore more appropriate to make the transformational project of global decarbonization a success.",CO2 zero emissions; Massive CDR; Actionable policy guideline; Sector specific technologies; Major emitting sectors,Editorial Material,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8727464079856873,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
898239,Geoengineering governance-by-default: an earth system governance perspective,"Geoengineering-the deliberate interference in the climate system to affect global warming-could have significant global environmental and social implications. How to shape formal geoengineering governance mechanisms is an issue of debate. This paper describes and analyses the geoengineering governance landscape that has developed in the absence of explicit geoengineering regulation. An Earth System Governance perspective provides insight into the formation of norms resulting from an overlap in international treaties and from the actions of engaged non-state agents. Specifically, the paper explores the instruments and actors having effect in existing formal and informal geoengineering governance mechanisms. It finds that geoengineering is subject to a form of 'governance-by-default'. This is due to a situation in which state actors have not resolved the tension between two legal norms: that of 'precaution' and that of 'harm minimisation'. This governance-by-default is characterised by uneven regulation from existing multilateral agreements established for other purposes, an absence of regulation specifically focused on geoengineering, guidance from an international ambition to hold global average warming below 2 A degrees C and to achieve net-zero emissions in the second half of the century, and strong normative engagement by the research community. Governance-by-default is likely to be a stopgap development until more enduring and focused governance emerges.",Climate change; Climate engineering; Solar radiation management; Carbon dioxide removal; International law,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8713371157646179,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
186706,Toward policy integration: Assessing carbon capture and storage policies in Japan and Norway,"The objective of this paper is to develop independent and systematic criteria for assessing CCS policy in terms of its level of policy integration. We believe that we should assess CCS policy in terms of the distance to an ideal integrated CCS policy in order to keep track of its trajectory toward sustainable development. After reviewing the existing literature of environmental policy integration, an assessment framework for integrated CCS policy is developed based on Arild Underdal's notion of 'integrated policy' then, its usefulness is demonstrated by applying it to CCS policies in Japan and Norway. In the final part, we summarize the findings of the cases and conclude with some observations regarding explanatory factors of the difference in terms of the achieved level of policy integration between Japan and Norway's CCS policies, and some policy implications derived from the analysis based on the framework.

119832,"The performance of the Norwegian carbon dioxide, capture and storage innovation system","In order to take up Norway's twin challenge of reducing CO2 emissions, while meeting its growing energy demand with domestic resources, the deployment of carbon Capture and storage (CCS) plays an important role in Norwegian energy policies. This Study uses the Functions of Innovation Systems approach to identify key policy issues that need to be addressed in order to prolong Not-way's international leadership position in the development of CCS. The analysis shows that Norway has been Successful in building an innovation system around CCS technology. The key determinants for this achievement are pinpointed in this article. However, the evolution of the innovation system seems to have entered a critical phase that is decisive for a further thriving development of CCS in Norway. The results provide a clear understanding of the current impediments in the CCS innovation system and stress the need to direct policy initiatives at the identified weak system functions-i.e. entrepreneurial activity and market formation-to improve the performance of the system. We discuss how policyrnakers can use these insights to develop a coherent set of policy instruments that would foster the deployment of CCS concepts related to power production and enhanced oil recovery in Norway.

2662512,Introducing BECCS through HPC to the research agenda: The case of combined heat and power in Stockholm,"In the years since COP21 in Paris, awareness of the need for carbon sinks has grown rapidly. However, policy instruments supporting a path to this target are still lacking. Bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) may provide a way to rapidly reduce global warming. In the Nordics, much of the basic infrastructure for successful BECCS implementation is already in place. So why is not more happening? This study provides insights to barriers and policy implications in relation to successful BECCS implementation. Though implementation could support economic growth and welfare development, the cost is relatively high for individual utilities. In the deregulated competitive heating market in the case of Stockholm, cost transfer to customers is prohibited, effectively impeding implementation. Moreover, while present national or EU-based support schemes could cover investments, the operating cost is high, so other economic policy approaches are required. Lastly, this paper shows that BECCS on combined heat and power plants has a potential, but requires much more research. Thus it is suggested that negative emission technologies in energy systems are brought into research agendas such as the future of combined heat and power and urban multi energy systems.

493861,The state of legislation and policy protecting Australia's mangrove and salt marsh and their ecosystem services,"Saline coastal wetlands, such as mangrove and coastal salt marsh, provide many ecosystem services. In Australia, large areas have been lost since European colonization, particularly as a result of drainage, infilling and flood-mitigation works, often starting in the mid-19th century and aimed primarily towards converting land to agricultural, urban or industrial uses. These threats remain ongoing, and will be exacerbated by rapid population growth and climate change in the 21st century. Establishing the effect of wetland loss on the delivery of ecosystem services is confounded by the absence of a nationally consistent approach to mapping wetlands and defining the boundaries of different types of coastal wetland. In addition, climate change and its projected effect on mangrove and salt marsh distribution and ecosystem services is poorly, if at all, acknowledged in existing legislation and policy. Intensifying climate change means that there is little time to be complacent; indeed, there is an urgent need for proper valuation of ecosystem services and explicit recognition of ecosystem services within policy and legislation. Seven actions are identified that could improve protection of coastal wetlands and the ecosystem services they provide, including benchmarking and improving coastal wetland extent and health, reducing complexity and inconsistency in governance arrangements, and facilitating wetland adaptation and ecosystem service delivery using a range of relevant mechanisms. Actions that build upon the momentum to mitigate climate change by sequestering carbon 'blue carbon' could achieve multiple desirable objectives, including clithate-change mitigation and adaptation, floodplain rehabilitation and habitat protection.

2679141,The importance of designing a comprehensive Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) & Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for carbon capture and storage in Japan,"CCS projects involve a complex legal mechanism. The IPCC (2005) clearly indicated that installations of CCS technology require 'long-term management' by: ensuring careful site selection; monitoring systems; regulations; and remediation and liability measures. While a large volume of legal study on CCS has been undertaken, a variety of SEA and EIA and their possible mixed approaches are also being considered for designing an effective policy and legal framework for CCS (e.g. IEAGHG, 2007; and Koornneef et al. 2008, 2011). Yet, the best practice of the mixed approach to assisting a policy, legal and regulatory framework is unclear, due to the lack of experience and the varied levels of comprehension. Japan intends to commercialise CCS technology in the future. This paper provides an analysis of examining: whether the key roles and elements of SEA and EIA in response to long-term management are being covered in the current CCS law in Japan. The outcome of this study creates a novel framework of legal analysis, an application of the framework that articulate insights into Japan's legal issues, and a set of potentially useful lessons for the future design of policy and legal framework for CCS projects.","Carbon capture and storage; Policy, law and regulation; Strategic environmental assessment; Environmental impact assessment; Reguratory framworks",Article; Proceedings Paper,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8705609440803528,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

With marine geoengineering based upon placement of matter in the marine environment, the London Protocol has decided that such activities fall under its scope. It has considered and prohibited ocean fertilization except for research purposes only, and a procedure is provided for new marine geoengineering activities to be considered.

510683,India and Climate-change Mitigation,"This chapter examines India's role in climate-change mitigation. It notes India's unwillingness or refusal to join a treaty and take on internationally agreed binding targets and argues that the country should reconsider its stance and negotiate to join a mitigation treaty, say in 2020, if it can negotiate a fair deal. The chapter first outlines the criteria that a global mitigation agreement would need to satisfy and stresses the importance of cap-andtrade as the keystone of that agreement. It then considers the inescapability of ethics in determining the fair distribution of the costs of mitigation and suggests that there is a strong moral case for all or most of the global costs being borne by the advanced countries. It also explores the implications of some specific permit-allocation schemes under cap-and-trade, along with recent attempts to model them and the financial transfers that are implied, India's energy and greenhouse gas emissions profile, and the cost of abating carbon when carbon capture and sequestration technology becomes available for deployment. The chapter concludes by assessing India's negotiating position in future climate bargaining. © Oxford Review of Economic Policy, 2009.

2480220,Analysis and recommendations for European carbon dioxide utilization policies,"Due to lower-cost energy supplies elsewhere, Europe needs resource efficient technologies to safeguard the competitiveness of its energy-intensive industries. The technical feasibility of the CCU value chain components (carbon capture, transportation and utilization) has been widely studied in literature. However infrastructural, regulatory and business strategic issues have received less attention. A review of the relevant policies (e.g. European Emissions Trading Scheme, Renewable Fuels and Waste Directives) has been performed. Stakeholder engagement and the stakeholder influence mapping was used to examine potential climate change, circular economy, renewable energy and regional industrial development policies that can support CO2 utilization value chains. The main contribution of the paper is to outline potential benefits of policies to foster the production and uptake of CO2-derived products such as methanol, polyurethane and mineral construction aggregates. Another outcome is to illustrate the role of key policy-making stakeholders in assessing the suitability of current statutes and the impact of potential changes. An important finding was that the development of connectivity infrastructure is a key missing enabler and more attention to policy on infrastructure is required.

105216,Implications of geoengineering under the 1.5 °C target: Analysis and policy suggestions,"The Paris Agreement introduced a 1.5 °C target to control the rise in global temperature, but clear arrangements for feasible implementation pathways were not made. Achieving the 1.5 °C target imposes high requirements on global emission reduction. Nationally Determined Contributions of all Parties are far from the 1.5 °C target, and conventional emission reduction technologies and policies will also have difficulty in fulfilling this task. In this context, geoengineering is gaining interest in the international arena. The Paris Agreement includes afforestation, carbon capture, utilization and storage, and negative emission technologies such as bio-energy with carbon capture and store. All of these techniques are CO2 removal technologies that belong to geoengineering. Solar radiation management, which is highly controversial, has also attracted increased attention in recent years. Although the outline of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 °C does not include a specific section on geoengineering issues yet, geoengineering is an unconventional technical option that cannot be avoided in research and discussions on impact assessment, technical options, ethics, and international governance under the 1.5 °C target.

82274,Reducing abrupt climate change risk using the Montreal Protocol and other regulatory actions to complement cuts in CO2 emissions,"Current emissions of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) have already committed the planet to an increase in average surface temperature by the end of the century that may be above the critical threshold for tipping elements of the climate system into abrupt change with potentially irreversible and unmanageable consequences. This would mean that the climate system is close to entering if not already within the zone of ""dangerous anthropogenic interference'' (DAI). Scientific and policy literature refers to the need for ""early,'' ""urgent,'' ""rapid,"" and ""fast-action"" mitigation to help avoid DAI and abrupt climate changes. We define ""fast-action'' to include regulatory measures that can begin within 2-3 years, be substantially implemented in 5-10 years, and produce a climate response within decades. We discuss strategies for short-lived non-CO2 GHGs and particles, where existing agreements can be used to accomplish mitigation objectives. Policy makers can amend the Montreal Protocol to phase down the production and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with high global warming potential. Other fast-action strategies can reduce emissions of black carbon particles and precursor gases that lead to ozone formation in the lower atmosphere, and increase biosequestration, including through biochar.

1595356,"The case of conflicting Finnish peatland management - Skewed representation of nature, participation and policy instruments","Peatlands that are close to a natural state are rich in biodiversity and are significant carbon storages. Simultaneously, peat resources are of interest to industry, which leads to competing interests and tensions regarding the use and management of peatlands. In this case study, we studied knowledge-management interactions through the development of participation and the resulting representation of nature (how nature was described), as well as the proposed and implemented conservation policy instruments. We focused on the years 2009-2015, when peatland management was intensively debated in Finland. We did an interpretative policy analysis using policy documents (Peatland Strategy; Government Resolution; Proposal for Conservation Programme) and environmental legislation as central data. Our results show how the representation of nature reflected the purpose of the documents and consensus of participants' values. The representation of nature changed from skewed use of ecosystem services to detailed ecological knowledge. However, simultaneously, political power changed and the planned supplementation programme for peatland conservation was not implemented. The Environment Protection Act was reformulated so that it prohibited the use of the most valuable peatlands. Landowners did not have the chance to fully participate in the policy process.

648390,REDD+ in Brazil: A profusion of pilot projects with an institutional framework still under construction,"Brazil adopted its first laws on the REDD mechanism (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation) in 2008.

From surveys based on interviews with those involved and field observations supplemented by an analysis of the regulations and the bibliography, this article sets out to elucidate the construction of the REDD+ institutional framework in Brazil, with a description of external financial contributions. Although the institutional framework is still under construction and the national REDD+ strategy still awaiting development and adoption, REDD+ in Brazil is already being received with great enthusiasm, as illustrated by numerous initiatives from federated States (Amazonas, Para, Acre and Mato Grosso) as well as many pilot projects. The regional contexts of these pilot projects show that they are mainly taking place in areas that are already under protection (protected areas or indigenous lands), although they could have focused more particularly on the areas most threatened by deforestation.

654605,Implications of current developments in international liability for the practice of marine geo-engineering activities,"Ocean fertilization was first introduced as a carbon dioxide mitigation technique in the 1980s. However, its effectiveness to slow down climate change is uncertain and it is expected to damage the marine environment. Consequently, international law, including the London Convention/Protocol and the Convention on Biological Diversity, limits this activity to scientific research purposes. The applicability and scope of existing treaties for regulating this activity have been reviewed within international legal systems, in particular within the London Protocol. The establishment of a liability regime with respect to these activities has also been raised during a discussion on regulation of ocean fertilization under the London Protocol. One of the key purposes of the liability regime could be to make ocean users more cautious when exploring and exploiting the oceans through charging cleaning costs or imposing compensation for damage. This paper aims to identify such a preventative effect of the international liability regime, in particular, state liability.

402738,A portfolio system of climate treaties,"Introduction Climate change is so fundamental a challenge that it may be best addressed from a multiple of perspectives, using a multiple of approaches. This is a radically different concept from the arrangement developed thus far. Under the Kyoto Protocol, emission reduction obligations apply to entire economies, not to individual sectors; reforestation (which sequesters and therefore removes carbon dioxide or CO2 from the atmosphere) is allowed to substitute for abatement (which reduces greenhouse gas [GHG] additions to the atmosphere, relative to “business as usual”); the emissions of different countries can be traded; and increases in the emission of one gas can be offset by reductions in the emission of another. This approach has one great virtue: it promotes cost-effective abatement. Unfortunately, this approach has also (so far, at least) failed to address the more important objective, which is to reduce GHG emissions and ultimately to stabilize atmospheric concentrations. There may be different explanations for this. My diagnosis is that this failure is due to a lack of robust enforcement. So, why not add an enforcement capability? As I shall explain in this chapter, it may not be possible to enforce the current treaty design. If enforcement is important—and I shall argue here that it is essential—then a better strategy may be to break up the problem, treating different sources and types of gases separately. This strategy may succeed better at reducing emissions overall. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,Book Chapter,2009.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8680858612060547,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
316900,Geoengineering: Governance and technology policy,"As a participant in several international agreements on climate change, the United States has joined with other nations to express concern about climate change. However, at the national level the United States has not yet developed a comprehensive climate change policy. In the absence of a comprehensive policy direction, technological advances are creating alternatives to the traditional approaches to climate change (mitigation and adaptation). If deployed, these new technologies could modify the Earth's climate on a large scale. Moreover, these new technologies may become available to foreign governments and entities in the private sector to use unilaterally-without authorization from the United States government or an international treaty. The term ?geoengineering? describes this array of technologies that aim, through large-scale and deliberate modifications of the Earth's energy balance, to reduce temperatures and counteract anthropogenic climate change. Most of these technologies are at the conceptual and research stages, and their effectiveness at reducing global temperatures has yet to be proven. Moreover, very few studies have been published that document the cost, environmental effects, sociopolitical impacts, and legal implications of geoengineering. If geoengineering technologies were to be deployed, they are expected to have the potential to cause significant transboundary effects. In general, geoengineering technologies are categorized as either a carbon dioxide removal (CDR) method or a solar radiation management (SRM) method. CDR methods address the warming effects of greenhouse gases by removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. CDR methods include ocean fertilization, and carbon capture and sequestration. SRM methods address climate change by increasing the reflectivity of the Earth's atmosphere or surface. Aerosol injection and space-based reflectors are examples of SRM methods. SRM methods do not remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, but can be deployed faster with relatively immediate global cooling results compared to CDR methods. In addition to seeking an understanding of the science behind the different geoengineering technologies, policymakers are considering policies and strategies for addressing geoengineering at the national and international levels. To date, there is limited federal involvement in, or oversight of, geoengineering. However, some states as well as some federal agencies, notably the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Defense, have taken actions related to geoengineering research or projects. At the international level, there is no international agreement or organization governing the full spectrum of possible geoengineering activities. Nevertheless, provisions of many international agreements, including those relating to climate change, maritime pollution, and air pollution, would likely inform the types of geoengineering activities that state parties to these agreements might choose to pursue. In 2010, the Convention on Biological Diversity adopted provisions calling for member parties to abstain from geoengineering unless the parties have fully considered the risks and impacts of those activities on biodiversity. With the possibility that geoengineering technologies may be developed and climate change remains an issue of global concern, policymakers may determine whether geoengineering is an issue that warrants attention at either the federal or international level. If so, policymakers will also need to consider whether geoengineering can be effectively addressed by amendments to existing laws and international agreements or, alternatively, whether new laws and international treaties would need to be developed.",Agriculture; Biodiversity; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Contracts; Earth atmosphere; Environmental Protection Agency; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Pollution; Reflection; Anthropogenic climate changes; Carbon capture and sequestrations; Climate change policies; Department of Defense; International treaties; Socio-political impacts; Technological advances; Traditional approaches; Public policy,Book Chapter,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8679801225662231,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
1838279,Carbon capture and storage and the London Protocol: recent efforts to enable transboundary CO2 transfer,"In the absence of new energy policies or supply constraints, the International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in 2050 will be twice 2007 levels. However, the ETP 2012 2DG Scenario provides a technically achievable, low-cost strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to a level consistent with a 2 degrees C temperature increase. Under the 2DG Scenario, carbon capture and storage (CCS) would contribute just under one-fifth of total emissions reductions by 2050. To enable CCS to contribute at the levels in the 2DG Scenario, rapid growth in the number CCS projects is needed between today and 2020, and then the number of projects must grow steadily through 2050. As well as being a major financial, technical and logistical challenge, this is a significant regulatory challenge. Legal obstacles associated with global CCS deployment must be removed today including the prohibition on transboundary CO2 transfer under the 1996 Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, 1972 (London Protocol). This paper reviews recent international actions to remove this prohibition; undertakes a legal analysis to identify possible options available to contracting parties under international law to allow transborder movement, pending entry into force of a formal, 2009 amendment enabling cross-border transportation of CO2; and makes clear recommendations on the next best approach. It then looks at efforts undertaken by contracting parties and other organisations in 2011 and 2012 to update the 2007 Specific Guidelines for Assessment of Carbon Dioxide Streams for Disposal into Sub-seabed Geological Formations (2007 CO2 Storage Guidelines) in light of the 2009 amendment.

5283271,Splitting Climate Engineering Governance: How Problem Structure Shapes Institutional Design,"This article adds conceptual discipline to a well-rehearsed but largely intuitive argument within the climate engineering community that carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM) should be treated separately - 'split' rather than 'lumped' - in policy discussions. Specifically, we build the first, theoretically derived argument for 'splitting'. We do this by engaging a set of theoretical insights from the international relations literature, having to do with the relationship between problem structure and institutional design. Centrally, we apply some key elements of problem structure - which allows us to compare policy issues along variables such as geographic scope, costs, and actor number and asymmetries - to the cases of SRM and CDR. By analyzing their problem structures, we demonstrate that SRM and CDR are different in ways that are likely to yield different state preferences for institutional design, and thus policy proposals that split SRM and CDR are more likely to be adopted by states. In short, we construct a theoretical argument for 'splitting' SRM and CDR governance in global policy discussions.",,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8679575324058533,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
5299146,Analysis of forest-related policies for supporting ecosystem services-based forest management in Bangladesh,"The role of the ecosystem services concept in natural resource management policies is gaining popularity globally as a means to offer increased protection of biodiversity conservation, integrated natural resource management and for promoting sustainable forest management. However, assessments of the concept in supporting forest management, through its inclusion in forest policy, is yet to be fully understood in a developing-country context. We analysed national forest-related policy to determine if the elements of the ecosystem services concept or ecosystem services categories were represented in order to support regional and national forest and tree management and rural livelihoods in Bangladesh. Specifically we assessed the policy objectives, statements and proposed programmes of ten policy/legislative documents. We applied a weighted scoring system to assess the coherence between existing policies and the ecosystem services concept and three categories of ecosystem services (provisioning, regulating and cultural services). It was found that, while ecosystem services were mentioned in all forest-related policies in Bangladesh, only one policy covered the ecosystem services concept. No policies provided details on operational aspects, including ecosystem services assessment, the decision making process and scales of implementation. Different specific forest-and tree-based ecosystem services were not identified clearly in any current policy. All policies reviewed explicitly mentioned regulating services (i. e. carbon sequestration and water regulation) more often than provisioning and cultural services. Given this, we recommend that the current policies should consider ecosystem services-based management goals and decision making in order to maximise the local benefits of forests and trees in the contexts of diverse social-ecological systems. Different specific forest-and tree-based ecosystem services should be clearly identified in the current forestry and other natural resource management policies in order to enhance the synergy between forests and competing land management practices.",Policy; Sustainable forest management; Ecosystem services; Biodiversity; Livelihoods,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8678320646286011,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
324987,Designing a carbon market that protects forests in developing countries,"Firmly incorporated into the Kyoto Protocol, market mechanisms offer an innovative and cost-effective means of controlling atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases. However, as with markets for many other goods and services, a carbon market may generate negative environmental externalities. Possible interpretations and application of Kyoto provisions under COP-6bis and COP-7 raise concerns that rules governing forestry with respect to the Kyoto carbon market may increase pressure on native forests and their biodiversity in developing countries. In this paper, we assess the following two specific concerns with Kyoto provisions for forestry measures. First, whether, under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), by restricting allowable forestry measures to afforestation and reforestation, and explicitly excluding protection of threatened native forests, the Kyoto Protocol will enhance incentives for degradation and clearing of forests in developing countries; second, whether carbon crediting for forest management in Annex I (industrialized) regions under Article 3.4 creates a dynamic that can encourage displacement of timber harvests from Annex I countries to developing nations. Given current timber extraction patterns in developing regions, additional harvest pressure would certainly entail a considerable cost in terms of biodiversity loss. In both cases, we find that the concerns about deleterious impacts to forests and biodiversity are justified, although the scale of such impacts is difficult to predict. Both to ensure reliable progress in managing carbon concentrations and to avoid unintended consequences with respect to forest biodiversity, the further development of the Kyoto carbon market must explicitly correct these perverse incentives. We recommend several steps that climate policymakers can take to ensure that conservation and restoration of biodiversity-rich natural forests in developing countries are rewarded rather than penalized. To correct incentives to clear natural forests through CDM crediting for afforestation and reforestation, we recommend for the first commitment period that policymakers establish an early base year, such as 1990, such that lands cleared after that year would be ineligible for crediting. We further recommend an exception to this rule for CDM projects that are explicitly designed to promote natural forest restoration and that pass rigorous environmental impact review. Restoration efforts are typically most effective on lands that are adjacent to standing forests and hence likely to have been recently cleared. Thus, we recommend for these projects establishing a more recent base year, such as 2000. For the second and subsequent commitment periods, we recommend that climate policymakers act to restrain inter-annex leakage and its impacts by ensuring that crediting for forest management in industrialized countries is informed by modelling efforts to anticipate the scale of leakage associated with different Annex I 'Land use, land-use change and forestry' policy options, and coupled with effective measures to protect natural forests in developing countries. The latter should include expanding the options permitted under the CDM to carbon crediting for projects that protect threatened forests from deforestation and forest degradation. Ultimately, carbon market incentives for forest clearing can be reduced and incentives for forest conservation most effectively strengthened by fully capturing carbon emissions associated with deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries under a future emissions cap. Finally, we note that these recommendations have broader relevance to any forest-based measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions developed outside of the specific context of the Kyoto Protocol.",carbon markets; Clean Development Mechanism; biodiversity; plantations; reforestation; leakage,Article,2002.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.867707371711731,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1993084,"Subsistence protection and mitigation ambition: Necessities, economic and climatic","The distinction between subsistence emissions and luxury emissions was originally devised in 1992 to guard people so poor as to be able to afford only fossil fuels from being priced out of energy by market mechanisms like cap-and-trade that were proposed to assist with limiting climate change. Non-carbon energy can now be made as affordable and accessible as fossil fuel, but tensions remain between measures to support sustainable development and measures to control climate change. Consequently, the distinction between subsistence energy and luxury energy continues to be surprisingly relevant to current international political struggles. The most fully justified method for normative assessment of Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, the Climate Equity Reference Framework, presupposes the distinction.

2390673,An adaptive policy-based framework for China's Carbon Capture and Storage development,"China's political leadership has taken an increasingly public and proactive stance on climate change since 2014. This stance includes making a commitment that Chinese carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions will peak around 2030 and enacting measures through the 13th Five Year Plan to support energy efficiency, clean energy technology, and carbon management. Chinese policy-makers consider carbon capture and storage (CCS) a critical bridging technology to help accelerate the decarbonization of its economy. This paper reviews and analyzes Chinese CCS support policies from the perspective of an adaptive policymaking framework, recognizing uncertainty as an inherent element of the policymaking process and drawing general lessons for responding to changing circumstances. Notably, the political support for CCS in China remains fragmented with uncoordinated government leadership, undecided industry players, and even with opposing voices from some leading scientists. There is scope for expanding the framework to provide more granularity, in particular relating to the development of a CCS infrastructure and the development of storage focused CO2-EOR. Overall, given the role CCS can play to decarbonize China's power and other industrial sectors, a commitment to CCS from top policymakers and major stakeholders is needed.",CCS; policy; climate change; China,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8667824864387512,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

After years of implementation, local peat fires persist, however, and knowledge is still lacking about the challenges and opportunities for supporting the restoration process.

2370846,Demands on land: Mapping competing societal expectations for the functionality of agricultural soils in Europe,"The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union (EU) has been highly successful in securing the supply of food from Europe's agricultural land. However, new expectations have emerged from society on the functions that agricultural land should deliver, including the expectations that land should regulate and purify water, should sequester carbon to contribute to the mitigation of climate change, should provide a home for biodiversity and allow for the sustainable cycling of nutrients in animal and human waste streams. Through a series of reforms of the CAP, these expectations, or 'societal demands' have translated into a myriad of EU and national level policies aimed at safeguarding the sustainability and multifunctionality of European agriculture, resulting in a highly complex regulatory environment for land managers. The current reform of the CAP aims to simultaneously simplify and strengthen policy making on environmental protection and climate action, through the development of Strategic Plans at national level, which allow for more targeted and context-specific policy formation. In this paper, we contribute to the knowledge base underpinning the development of these Strategic Plans by mapping the variation in the societal demands for soil functions across EU Member States, based on an extensive review of the existing policy environment relating to sustainable and multifunctional land management. We show that the societal demands for primary production, water regulation and purification, carbon sequestration, biodiversity and nutrient cycling vary greatly between Member States, as determined by population, farming systems and livestock densities, geo-environmental conditions and landscape configuration. Moreover, the total societal demands for multifunctionality differs between Member States, with the lowest demands found in Member States that have designated the higher shares of EU CAP funding towards 'Pillar 2' expenditure, aimed at environmental protection and regional development. We review which lessons can be learnt from these observations, in the context of the proposals for the new CAP for the period 2021-2027, which include enhanced conditionality of direct income support for farmers and the instigation of eco-schemes in Pillar 1, in addition to Agri-Environmental and Climate Measures in Pillar 2. We conclude that the devolution of planning to Strategic Plans at national level provides an opportunity for more effective and targeted incentivisation of sustainable land management, provided that these plans take account for variations in the societal demand for soil functions, as well as the capacity of contrasting soils to deliver on this multifunctionality.",Agriculture; EU; LANDMARK; Soil; Policy; Sustainability,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8662635684013367,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The TIMES_PT optimisation model was used to derive MAC curves from a set of policy scenarios including one or more of the following policies: ban on nuclear power; ban on new coal power plants without carbon sequestration an storage: incentives to natural gas power plants: and a cap on biomass use. The different MAC shows the policies' effects in the potential for CO2 abatement. In 2020, in the most encompassing policy scenario, with all current and planned policies, is possible to abate only Lip to +35% of 1990 emissions at a cost below 23 epsilon t/CO2. In the more flexible policy scenarios, it is possible to abate up to - 10% of 1990 emissions below the same cost. The total energy system costs are 10-13% higher if all policies are implemented-76 to 101 B epsilon-roughly the equivalent to 2.01-2.65% of the 2005 CDR Thus, from a CO2 emission mitigation perspective, the existing policies introduce significant inefficiencies, possibly related to other policy goals.

1877860,Implications of geoengineering under the 1.5 degrees C target: Analysis and policy suggestions,"The Paris Agreement introduced a 1.5 degrees C target to control the rise in global temperature, but clear arrangements for feasible implementation pathways were not made. Achieving the 1.5 degrees C target imposes high requirements on global emission reduction. Nationally Determined Contributions of all Parties are far from the 1.5 degrees C target, and conventional emission reduction technologies and policies will also have difficulty in fulfilling this task. In this context, geoengineering is gaining interest in the international arena. The Paris Agreement includes afforestation, carbon capture, utilization and storage, and negative emission technologies such as bio-energy with carbon capture and store. All of these techniques are CO2 removal technologies that belong to geoengineering. Solar radiation management, which is highly controversial, has also attracted increased attention in recent years. Although the outline of the IPCC Special Report on 1.5 degrees C does not include a specific section on geoengineering issues yet, geoengineering is an unconventional technical option that cannot be avoided in research and discussions on impact assessment, technical options, ethics, and international governance under the 1.5 degrees C target.

5277232,"Carbon Removal as Carbon Revival? Bioenergy, Negative Emissions, and the Politics of Alternative Energy Futures","Conscious of the need to limit climate warming to 1.5 degrees, many countries are pinning their hopes upon carbon dioxide (CO2) removal through the industrial-scale combination of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). But it is not merely by storing captured CO2 that BECCS enthusiasts hope to harness biomass combustion for climate repair. Increasingly, more productive and ostensibly profitable uses for captured CO2 are also being identified. The concept of BECCS is evolving, in other words, into “BECCUS” —bioenergy with carbon capture, utilisation and storage. Against this backdrop, this Perspective sets out two main arguments. Firstly, regardless of the precise use to which captured CO2 is put, efforts to predicate large-scale negative emissions upon biomass combustion should in our view be understood as attempts to reconfigure the fundamental relationship between climate change and energy use, turning the latter from a historical driver of climate warming into a remedial tool of climate repair. Secondly, the emergence of BECCUS cannot be understood solely as an attempt to make bioenergy-based negative emissions more economically viable. At stake, rather, are conflicting ideas about the role that intensive energy use should play in future global sustainable development pathways. This Perspective therefore calls for governance frameworks for carbon dioxide removal to adjudicate between conflicting approaches to achieving negative emissions not only on the basis of technical efficiency, or even “on-the-ground” social and environmental impacts, but also according to compatibility with socially legitimate visions and understandings of what energy—and more specifically energy use—should ultimately be for in the post-fossil fuel era.

1563391,Blurred lines: The ethics and policy of Greenhouse Gas Removal at scale,"The topic of Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) for climate geoengineering is becoming increasingly salient following the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report and the Paris Agreement. GGR is thought of as a separate category to mitigation techniques such as low-carbon supply or demand reduction, yet multiple social, ethical and acceptability concerns cut across categories. We propose moving beyond classifying climate strategies as a set of discrete categories (which may implicitly homogenize diverse technologies), toward a prioritization of questions of scale of both technology and decision-making in the examination of social and ethical risks. This is not just a theoretical issue: important questions for policy, governance and finance are raised, for instance over the future inclusion of GGR in carbon markets. We argue that the conclusions drawn about how best to categorize, govern and incentivize any strategy will depend on the framing used, because different framings could lead to very different policy recommendations being drawn. Because of this, a robust approach to developing, governing and financing GGR should pay attention first to urgent concerns regarding democracy, justice and acceptability. © 2018 Cox, Pidgeon, Spence and Thomas.",Acceptability; Ethics; Geoengineering; Greenhouse gas removal; Policy; Risk,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8651061058044434,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Subsequently, the debate on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM) (frequently subsumed under ""geoengineering"") has been reinforced. Yet, it does not determine normatively whether those are legally valid approaches to climate protection.

5283082,y Challenges to the use of BECCS as a keystone technology in pursuit of 1.5 degrees C,"Non-technical summary Biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) is represented in many integrated assessment models as a keystone technology in delivering the Paris Agreement on climate change. This paper explores six key challenges in relation to large scale BECCS deployment and considers ways to address these challenges. Research needs to consider how BECCS fits in the context of other mitigation approaches, how it can be accommodated within existing policy drivers and goals, identify where it fits within the wider socioeconomic landscape, and ensure that genuine net negative emissions can be delivered on a global scale. Technical summary The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Paris Agreement sets a goal of limiting the global temperature increase to ""well below 2 degrees C"" and to pursue ""efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C"". Most emission pathways that are compatible with these goals are heavily reliant on negative emissions technologies (NETs), especially biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), at a global scale to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. The use of negative emissions in climate mitigation introduces a complex variety of technologies whose desirability, effectiveness and viability remain highly uncertain. This paper explores six key policy and governance challenges associated with BECCS, suggesting ways in which research could address some of these challenges: 1) How does BECCS fit with carbon budgets? 2) How negative is BECCS? 3) Can BECCS be delivered at sufficient scale? 4) Can sufficient biomass be provided sustainably? 5) How does BECCS fit into the policy context? 6) How does BECCS fit with climate agreements? Consideration of these challenges highlights the importance of a whole systems approach to assessing the use of BECCS and its potential as a keystone technology to deliver negative emissions.",energy; policies; politics and governance,Conference Paper,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8649212121963501,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5342566,The ABC of Governance Principles for Carbon Dioxide Removal Policy,"Climate change mitigation actions, including those aimed at developing and scaling carbon dioxide removal (CDR) activities spanning the industrial, energy, and agroforestry sector, emerge in a context of internationally shared norms that include governance objectives, legal provisions and informal expectations, and societal expectations. Established governance principles provide normative orientation for policy including when targeting the development and scaling of CDR. Knowledge of these principles can guide effective discussion and evaluation of policy options. To facilitate discussion of mitigation options among experts and CDR practitioners, this study excerpts governance principles from legislative texts, the climate governance literature, and the CDR literature with relevance to CDR policy considerations. To illustrate the relevance of the governance principles found for evaluating policy options, we apply them to three technology groups of CDR: Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS), Direct Air Carbon Capture and Storage (DACCS), and forestry. This exercise indicates the importance of more intensive attention to the normative dimension of mitigation policies in ongoing deliberative and planning processes.

3874582,Political Perspectives on Geoengineering: Navigating Problem Definition and Institutional Fit,"Geoengineering technologies are by definition only effective at scale, and so international policy development of some sort will be unavoidable. It is therefore important to include governability as a dimension when assessing the technologies' feasibility and potential role in addressing climate change. The few existing studies that address this question indicate that for some technologies, policy development at the international level could be exceedingly difficult. This study provides an in-depth, theoretically informed analysis of the obstacles that policymakers face when addressing geoengineering governance. Using data in the form of negotiation proceedings, observations, and interviews with government officials from seven different countries, it argues that a significant part of the challenge lies in dissonances between problem definitions that are widely used in the geoengineering governance debate and the structures and expectations that shape environmental policy making. These include a lack of institutional fit between the processbased differentiation of geoengineering technologies (carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management) and the international legal architecture, a lack of fit between the urgency of demanded governance action and prevalent scientific and political uncertainties, and a lack of fit between risk-risk trade-off narratives and the precautionary norms of environmental governance.",,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8647598624229431,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
252379,The green paradox: Why the offer should not be forgotten in climate policy,"Despite its efforts and obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU has not succeeded in even making a dent in the rapidly rising trend of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions. If anything, the trend has accelerated in recent years. In his Thünen Lecture given to the Verein für Socialpolitik in October 2007, the author criticizes the attempt to slow down global warming by means of unilaterally curtailing the demand for fossil fuels and develops an intertemporal supply side approach to the economics of global warming. He advances the hypothesis that the ineffectiveness of demand policies results from anticipation effects on the part of the owners of fossil fuel resources. In addition to the threat of potential ousting by domestic rivals, the threat of falling energy prices (against a modified Hotelling trend) due to greening public policies and increasing participation in worldwide emissions trading systems gives resource owners the incentive to speed up extraction. Feasible policy measures that do not encounter such problematic anticipation effects include the rapid creation of a complete worldwide monopsony for fossil fuels that can dictate quantities rather than having to rely on price signals. Moreover, source taxes on the financial returns of resource owners will provide additional conservation motives; technical measures including afforestation and sequestration may also be a way to reduce the speed of global warming. © 2008, Verein für Socialpolitik und Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,Article,2008.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8644899129867554,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
782965,The Need for Governance of Climate Geoengineering,"Keeping global temperature rise to within 1.5-2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels is looking increasingly unlikely through mitigation alone. While increased adaptation to inevitable climate impacts will be necessary, a new realism is creeping into the climate debate. A growing number of scientists are proposing geoengineering technologies to deal with the expected shortfall, both through carbon dioxide removal and possibly through solar radiation management. But both approaches bring risks and pose significant governance challenges, and would likely affect different communities in different ways. As geoengineering moves mainstream, it is time to put governance at the heart of future discussion, and to broaden the debate from academia to governments, treaty bodies, faith groups, and civic organizations. The Carnegie Climate Geoengineering Governance Initiative is a major new effort to catalyze this conversation, bringing together players from a wide range of social, geographical, and professional backgrounds. It argues that policymakers need to take an ethical risk management approach, informed by continued research. How should transborder and transgenerational ethical issues be addressed? How will governance frameworks withstand geopolitical change? Can we build on existing international treaties and institutions, or do we need new ones? And most immediately, how should further research on solar engineering be governedgiven current plans to start experiments in the stratosphere?

3298610,Understanding the value and limits of nature-based solutions to climate change and other global challenges,"There is growing awareness that 'nature-based solutions' (NbS) can help to protect us from climate change impacts while slowing further warming, supporting biodiversity and securing ecosystem services. However, the potential of NbS to provide the intended benefits has not been rigorously assessed. There are concerns over their reliability and cost-effectiveness compared to engineered alternatives, and their resilience to climate change. Trade-offs can arise if climate mitigation policy encourages NbS with low biodiversity value, such as afforestation with non-native monocultures. This can result in maladaptation, especially in a rapidly changing world where biodiversity-based resilience and multi-functional landscapes are key. Here, we highlight the rise of NbS in climate policy-focusing on their potential for climate change adaptation as well as mitigation-and discuss barriers to their evidence-based implementation. We outline the major financial and governance challenges to implementing NbS at scale, highlighting avenues for further research. As climate policy turns increasingly towards greenhouse gas removal approaches such as afforestation, we stress the urgent need for natural and social scientists to engage with policy makers. They must ensure that NbS can achieve their potential to tackle both the climate and biodiversity crisis while also contributing to sustainable development. This will require systemic change in the way we conduct research and run our institutions.

5343527,"Scrutinizing net zero: The legal problems of counting greenhouse gas emissions, removals and offsets together","Net-zero targets play an important role in public and private climate governance. The concept of net zero implies that emissions can be outbalanced by compensatory activities such as greenhouse gas removals and offsetting. However, emissions and compensation measures are not equivalent in terms of their climate impact. The climate benefits of currently available compensation practices are more uncertain and less permanent than the harm caused by emissions. From a legal perspective, two problems can be observed. First, aggregating emissions and non-equivalent compensation measures may violate the requirement that greenhouse gas inventories should be accurate. Second, it may conflict with the principle that only effective mitigation measures should count towards emission reduction targets. © 2022 The Author.

310196,Ocean iron fertilization and international law,"Intentional ocean fertilization and the commercial sale of associated carbon offsets raise a number of issues in international law. On the one hand, states are obliged to adopt adaptation and mitigation measures to prevent dangerous climate change. On the other hand, international law obliges states to protect and preserve the marine environment and to act in a precautionary manner in the face of scientific uncertainty. In this article, we examine the application of the international Law of the Sea to ocean fertilization, with particular reference to the law's dumping regime, which prohibits the dumping of wastes or other materials from vessels into the ocean. We then examine the application of the international legal regime on climate change to ocean fertilization and assess the international legal basis for the sale of carbon offsets or carbon credits associated with ocean fertilization. We conclude that ocean fertilization is governed by the dumping regime and that its commercialization is inconsistent with international law unless and until independent, internationally peer-reviewed scientific research and assessment demonstrates that it is effective and that its benefits outweigh the risks to the marine environment.",international law; Law of the Sea; ocean fertilization; ocean dumping; London convention; London protocol,Article,2008.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.863709568977356,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
709232,Geoengineering the climate: an overview and update,"The climate change that we are experiencing now is caused by an increase in greenhouse gases due to human activities, including burning fossil fuels, agriculture and deforestation. There is now widespread belief that a global warming of greater than 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels would be dangerous and should therefore be avoided. However, despite growing concerns over climate change and numerous international attempts to agree on reductions of global CO2 emissions, these have continued to climb. This has led some commentators to suggest more radical 'geoengineering' alternatives to conventional mitigation by reductions in CO2 emissions. Geoengineering is deliberate intervention in the climate system to counteract man-made global warming. There are two main classes of geoengineering: direct carbon dioxide removal and solar radiation management that aims to cool the planet by reflecting more sunlight back to space. The findings of the review of geoengineering carried out by the UK Royal Society in 2009 are summarized here, including the climate effects, costs, risks and research and governance needs for various approaches. The possible role of geoengineering in a portfolio of responses to climate change is discussed, and various recent initiatives to establish good governance of research activity are reviewed. Key findings include the following. - Geoengineering is not a magic bullet and not an alternative to emissions reductions. - Cutting global greenhouse gas emissions must remain our highest priority. (i) But this is proving to be difficult, and geoengineering may be useful to support it. - Geoengineering is very likely to be technically possible. (i) However, there are major uncertainties and potential risks concerning effectiveness, costs and social and environmental impacts. - Much more research is needed, as well as public engagement and a system of regulation (for both deployment and for possible large-scale field tests). - The acceptability of geoengineering will be determined as much by social, legal and political issues as by scientific and technical factors. Some methods of both types would involve release of materials to the environment, either to the atmosphere or to the oceans, in areas beyond national jurisdiction. The intended impacts on climate would in any case affect many or all countries, possibly to a variable extent. There are therefore inherent international implications for deployment of such geoengineering methods (and possibly also for some forms of research), which need early and collaborative consideration, before any deployment or large-scale experiments could be undertaken responsibly.",geoengineering; climate change; governance; uncertainty,Review,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8636682629585266,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
1868450,"Regulating the operational and long-term liabilities associated with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): Approaches and lessons from Europe, Australia and Canada","Several jurisdictions globally have now adopted detailed legislative regimes for regulating and facilitating the development of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) activities. While many aspects of these regulatory regimes vary between countries, states and territories, the twin issues of operational and long-term liability have received considerable attention from governments, industry and the wider public. This paper, which is based upon a broader Global CCS Institute study completed in 2014, compares the approach adopted by legislators in jurisdictions in Australia, Europe and Canada in the design of their regulatory rules for CCS liability. In doing so, the paper considers how those rules will fit within the wider liability regimes which prevail in each jurisdiction, including those found under civil and administrative law.

1739186,A Study on Regulatory Requirements of CCS Technology Development in Taiwan,"The UNFCCC COP17/CMP7, which was held from November 28th to December 9th 2011 in Durban, South Africa. The conference concluded the decision of taking modalities and procedures for carbon dioxide capture and storage in geological formations as clean development mechanism project activities. Although Taiwan is not a member state of the United Nations, the current draft of the Greenhouse Gas Emission Reduction Act of Taiwan is developing in accordance with the principles of the United Nations CDM review mechanism. We hope we can establish consistency and so as to achieve the reduction goal of the industry. The main purpose of carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is to reduce the greenhouse gas emission. However, the activity will involve four issues of land ownership, environmental pollution and economic incentives. Furthermore, the impact to environment will be included four parts: geological storage site selection, storage and monitoring, infringement and liability, which depended on policy trade-offs issues. Carbon dioxide that is stored in geological formation tends to have the characteristics to spread around. This problem cannot be handled by current norms of land ownership and is prone to disputes. Therefore, based on requirements of maintaining social order and promoting public interests, it is necessary to establish relative laws and standards. This paper is to study the amendments to the current applicable laws and how to enact new provisions of the laws during CCS technology development in Taiwan under the existing regulatory framework, in order to assist the development of CCS technology.

5256951,Operationalizing the net-negative carbon economy,"The remaining carbon budget for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius will probably be exhausted within this decade(1,2). Carbon debt(3) generated thereafter will need to be compensated by net-negative emissions(4). However, economic policy instruments to guarantee potentially very costly net carbon dioxide removal (CDR) have not yet been devised. Here we propose intertemporal instruments to provide the basis for widely applied carbon taxes and emission trading systems to finance a net-negative carbon economy(5). We investigate an idealized market approach to incentivize the repayment of previously accrued carbon debt by establishing the responsibility of emitters for the net removal of carbon dioxide through 'carbon removal obligations' (CROs). Inherent risks, such as the risk of default by carbon debtors, are addressed by pricing atmospheric CO2 storage through interest on carbon debt. In contrast to the prevailing literature on emission pathways, we find that interest payments for CROs induce substantially more-ambitious near-term decarbonization that is complemented by earlier and less-aggressive deployment of CDR. We conclude that CROs will need to become an integral part of the global climate policy mix if we are to ensure the viability of ambitious climate targets and an equitable distribution of mitigation efforts across generations.",,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8631365299224854,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
5292856,Retrofitting towards a greener marine shipping future: Reassembling ship fuels and liquefied natural gas in Norway,"The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions has entered regulatory agendas in shipping. In Norway, a debate has been ongoing for over a decade about whether liquefied natural gas (LNG) ship fuel enables or impedes the transition to a greener future for shipping. This paper explores the assembling of ship fuel before and after the introduction of a controversial carbon tax on LNG. It reconstructs how changes in the regulatory apparatus prompted the reworking of natural gas into a ship fuel, yet later slowed down the development of LNG in a strategy to promote alternative zero-emission fuels such as hydrogen. Following ship fuel as socio-materiality in motion, we find that fossil fuels are reworked into new modes of application as part of transition policies. Natural gas continues to be enacted as an ""enabler of transition"" in the context of shipping, given that current government policies work to support the production of hydrogen from natural gas and carbon capture and storage (CCS). New modes of accounting for emissions reassemble existing fossil fuel materiality by means of CCS and fossil-based zero-emission fuels. We examine retrofit as a particular kind of reassembling and as a prism for studying the politics of fuel and the relation between transitions and existing infrastructures.",Green shipping; Regulation; Liquefied natural gas (LNG); Hydrogen; Infrastructure; Retrofit,Article,2022.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8631153702735901,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

One of the current strategies to control the spread of forest fires is to restore 2.4 million hectares of the peatland which had burned in 2015, by 2020. Although it has been more than half of the period of the program, the idea of restoring the peatlands to control the spread of fires have increased by over 60%, compared to the same period last year. Since the implementation of peat restoration policy in Indonesia over three years ago, there is still no example of a successfully restored peat area. However, the peat restoration program includes a minimum three Components of restoration: 1) Ecology, 2) Economy, and 3) Society [1], which often remain unbalanced. This research aims to review the environmental policy program of restoring 2.4 million hectare peatlands which was established at the beginning of 2016.

One of Australia's emerging NRM governance domains is our national framework for greenhouse gas abatement (GGA), as delivered through a wide range of management practices in the Australian landscape. The emerging Landscape-Based GGA Domain represents an innovative governance space that straddles both the nation's broader NRM Policy and Delivery Domain and Australia's GGA Domain. As a point-in-time benchmark, we assess the health of this hybrid domain as it stood at the end of 2013. At that time, the domain was being progressed through the Australian government's Clean Energy Package and, more particularly, its Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI). While significant changes are currently under development by a new Australian government, this paper explores key areas of risk within the governance system underpinning this emerging hybrid domain at that point in time.

Coal is regarded as the most important indigenous energy source in Turkey together with hydropower to strengthen the supply security of the country. Turkish government set targets to fully utilize coal reserves of the country in next decades. However, the country is also in the process of becoming an EU Member State, hence, it is expected that the energy policies have to comply with the EU. Moreover, Turkey ratified Kyoto Protocol in 2009, thus the country should limit CO2 emission together with other greenhouse gases. The probable obstacles that Turkey may face due to the utilization of coal were determined as CO2 emissions, lack of technology and application in Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and health and safety issues. It is concluded that coal is a very important domestic energy source for Turkey but new policies have to be developed and adopted immediately, and more realistic targets for the country should be set accordingly.

From surveys based on interviews with those involved and field observations supplemented by an analysis of the regulations and the bibliography, this article sets out to elucidate the construction of the REDD+ institutional framework in Brazil, with a description of external financial contributions. Although the institutional framework is still under construction and the national REDD+ strategy still awaiting development and adoption, REDD+ in Brazil is already being received with great enthusiasm, as illustrated by numerous initiatives from federated States (Amazonas, Para, Acre and Mato Grosso) as well as many pilot projects. The regional contexts of these pilot projects show that they are mainly taking place in areas that are already under protection (protected areas or indigenous lands), although they could have focused more particularly on the areas most threatened by deforestation.

601658,South Africa's national REDD+ initiative: assessing the potential of the forestry sector on climate change mitigation,"Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+) is regarded by its proponents as one of the more efficient and cost effective ways to mitigate climate change. There was further progress toward the implementation of this mechanism at the 16th Conference of Parties (COP) in Cancun in December 2010. Many countries in southern African, including South Africa, have not been integrated (do not participate) into the UN-REDD+ programme, probably due to their low forest cover and national rates of deforestation. This paper discusses the potential contribution of REDD+ activities to the South African Government's pledge of reducing national greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 34% below business as usual by 2020. A number of issues such as complex land tenure system, limited forest cover and other conflicting environmental issues present challenges for REDD+ in South Africa. Despite these genuine concerns, REDD+ remains a practical strategy to contribute to climate change mitigation for South Africa. The paper raises the need for development of a variety of emission reduction programmes - not only in the energy sector. The paper also assesses several national options and opportunities towards a working REDD+ mechanism. It concludes by identifying key mechanisms for moving forward to prepare for REDD+ actions in South Africa and raises the urgent need for national dialogue between stakeholders and institutions to evaluate the feasibility of making use of the mechanism in South Africa and the Southern African Development Cooperation (SADC) region. The paper further addresses possible synergies and conflicts between the national climate change and forestry policies towards REDD+ development. It suggests that REDD+ should be part of the national dialogue on policy to respond to climate change and should be integrated into the national flagship programmes that the national climate change white paper seeks to implement. A multiple-benefit REDD+ initiative for South Africa can benefit from these international financial initiatives. It is anticipated that this initiative will provide a platform to enhance policy, institutional and technical stakeholder capacities to access financial incentives that may lead to sound environmental practises.

Its mitigation potential is not yet well explored, and carbon offsets generated through iron fertilization activities could currently not be traded on regulated carbon markets. Still, commercial interests in ocean iron fertilization already exist, which underlines the need to investigate a possible regulatory framework for it. To this end, I first discuss important basic aspects of ocean iron fertilization, namely its scientific background, quantitative potential, side effects, and costs. In a second step, I review regulatory aspects connected to ocean iron fertilization, like its legal status and open access issues. Moreover, I analyze how the regulations for afforestation and reforestation activities within the framework of the Kyoto Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could be applied to ocean iron fertilization. Main findings are that the quantitative potential of ocean iron fertilization is limited, that costs are higher than initially hoped, and that potential adverse side effects are severe. Moreover, the legal status of ocean iron fertilization is currently not well defined, open access might cause inefficiencies, and the CDM regulations could not be easily applied to ocean iron fertilization.

1992939,Targeting carbon dioxide removal in the European Union,"In principle, many climate policymakers have accepted that large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) is necessary to meet the Paris Agreement's mitigation targets, but they have avoided proposing by whom CDR might be delivered. Given its role in international climate policy, the European Union (EU) might be expected to lead the way. But among EU climate policymakers so far there is little talk on CDR, let alone action. Here we assess how best to 'target' CDR to motivate EU policymakers exploring which CDR target strategy may work best to start dealing with CDR on a meaningful scale. A comprehensive CDR approach would focus on delivering the CDR volumes required from the EU by 2100, approximately at least 50 Gigatonnes (Gt) CO2, according to global model simulations aiming to keep warming below 2 degrees C. A limited CDR approach would focus on an intermediate target to deliver the CDR needed to reach 'net zero emissions' (i.e. the gross negative emissions needed to offset residual positive emissions that are too expensive or even impossible to mitigate). We argue that a comprehensive CDR approach may be too intimidating for EU policymakers. A limited CDR approach that only addresses the necessary steps to reach the (intermediate) target of 'net zero emissions' is arguably more achievable, since it is a better match to the existing policy paradigm and would allow for a pragmatic phase-in of CDR while avoiding outright resistance by environmental NGOs and the broader public.",carbon dioxide removal; negative emissions; European Union; climate policy,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8618776798248291,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
5292404,Fixing flammable Forest: The scalar politics of peatland governance and restoration in Indonesia,"Peatland fires and the impact of transboundary haze are often intertwined with socio-environmental externalities of neoliberal forest governance and overlapping systems of resource property rights in Indonesia. New peatland governance strategies are emerging to address fires and haze by reorganising peatland management using a more ecologically relevant scale that territorialises peatland according to its hydrological characteristics. Employing the concept of the eco-scalar fix, this paper interrogates rescaling peatland governance as a strategy to address the socio-ecological crisis associated with the conversion of peatland into mono-agricultural land. However, rescaling peatland governance entails the risk of merely displacing socio-environmental crises to areas considered less ecologically important rather than addressing them. Drawing on a case study of a peatland restoration in Riau, Indonesia, this paper shows how emerging hybrid forms of peatland governance can address the environmental externalities that have unintentionally been created. This hybrid form of peatland governance has pressured actors across multiple types of property to rework the ways that environmental commons are controlled and accessed.",environmental commons; Indonesia; peatland fires; peatland hydrology; restoration; scale,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.861651599407196,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

To what extent does CDM regulation support active biodiversity management in the small-scale implementation of afforestation and reforestation projects? After analysing the above question, fresh concepts for better consideration of biodiversity aspects during the implementation of small-scale carbon sink projects in developing countries are presented. These new concepts are examined in the framework of the current process of legal establishment, which seeks to encourage cost-effective project implementation in cases where biodiversity impacts are appropriately taken into account during small-scale projects. Is it possible to create a workable and plausible conceptual set-up for considering additional efforts to preserve and enhance biodiversity while sequestering carbon - and to do it in a way that makes it possible to reward those efforts in the CDM framework? These questions are discussed here in a multidisciplinary manner. It is found that biodiversity specialized carbon management, which includes the new concepts, can be seen as a potential small-scale project framework for maintaining biodiversity and local development in and around a small-scale project area. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.",,Article,2009.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.861586332321167,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
4382242,Policy persistence: REDD+ between stabilization and contestation,"At this time of rapid global environmental change and demands for sweeping societal transformation, we call for greater scrutiny of the persistence of particular policies and ideas. In this Special Section we focus on REDD+, which for long has enjoyed remarkable global support in spite of poor outcomes and widespread criticisms. The central policy proposition of REDD+, that is, forest-based emissions reduction through market-based instruments and non-market means, are now carried forth under the new banner of Natural Climate Solutions. We examine REDD+ to understand how and why some environmental policies and ideas persist despite dubious impacts. We conceptualize policy persistence by drawing on three strands of political ecology literature - critical policy studies, assemblage studies, and political economy - that illuminate the dynamics of policy persistence in different yet complementary ways. We argue that the persistence of policies and policy ideas rests in a tentative balance of the counteracting processes of stabilization and contestation, which precipitate both intended and unintended outcomes. We show how the stabilization of REDD+ itself lends stability to broader ideas of forest-based climate change mitigation. We suggest that policy persistence is an area of political ecological research, which now calls for renewed engagement.",Policy persistence; REDD+; climate change mitigation; Natural Climate Solutions; political ecology,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8612964749336243,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5292665,"Banking on coal? Drivers of demand for Chinese overseas investments in coal in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia and Vietnam","This paper investigates why new coal-fired power plants are being financed and built in South and Southeast Asia given that new coal plants without carbon capture and storage are incompatible with a 1.5 degrees C temperature goal. The paper particularly focuses on developing countries where these coal-fired power plants are being built that are recipients of Chinese government-backed finance. The central research question of this paper is: Which factors drive the demand for financing for coal-fired power plants from China's policy banks? Field research was conducted in four recipient countries: India, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Bangladesh. We find that the demand for Chinese-backed coal plants in the four recipient countries is mainly driven by domestic policy that embraces a growth of coal-fired power in their economies. Recipient country demand is well matched by China's willingness to finance and export equipment and services to build new coal-fired power plants overseas. In every case, there are explicit, preferential domestic policies for coal, and in at least one case renewables are disallowed by regulation from competing with coal on a level-playing field. None have environmental policies that would require cleaner or more efficient plants to be constructed and operated. The main policy implication of the findings is that it is crucial for recipient countries to put in place the enabling policy conditions for an energy transition to a low-carbon future.",China; Coal power; Development finance; Carbon emissions; Enabling policies,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.861013650894165,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
219980,Sequestration through forestry and agriculture,"Current climate mitigation policies have not fully resolved contentious issues regarding the inclusion of carbon sequestration through changes in forestry and agricultural management practices. Terrestrial carbon sinks could be a low-cost mitigation option that fosters conservation and development, yet issues related to accurately documenting the amount of carbon sequestered undermine confidence that emission offsets through sequestration are equivalent to emission reductions. From an atmospheric perspective, net of CO2 removals through sequestration are equivalent to emission reductions over a given period of time. But carbon will not remain sequestered in biomass or soils indefinitely and investments in sequestration could stifle investments in reducing emissions from other sources. Many international climate agreements cap emissions from some countries or sectors but enable participation of uncapped countries or sectors for forestry and agricultural sequestration. This structure can prompt emission increases in parts of the uncapped entities that weaken the value of emission reductions earned through sequestration. This has been a minor issue under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol. Reduced emissions through deforestation and degradation is susceptible to the same problems. The purpose of this article is to review the science, politics, and policy that form the basis of arguments for and against the inclusion forestry and agricultural sequestration as a component of current and future international climate mitigation policies.

899214,When climate policy meets foreign policy: Pioneering and national interest in Norway's mitigation strategy,"This paper compares Norway's strategies to promote carbon sequestration based climate change mitigation measures Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). It aims to explain what makes Norway such a strong promoter of the two by focusing on the conceptual characteristics of CCS and REDD+. Treating Norway mitigation action portfolio as foreign policy, a two-level analytical framework is presented to this end. The analysis shows how initially unlikely ideas may be turned into lasting climate strategies when they contribute to bridge a state's national energy interests and international climate obligations. The paper adds to the empirical study of states' climate political behavior within the boundaries of a prevailing energy political paradigm.

1301497,Three layers of energy law for examining CO2 transport for carbon-capture and storage,"This research is a legal analysis concerning four scenarios for cross-border carbon dioxide (CO2) transport that could increase the deployment of carbon-capture and storage (CCS) deployment in Europe. The legal analysis categorizes the law into three levels-international, national and local-and considers the four scenarios in light of these three levels of energy law. Upon reviewing the four scenarios, it is clear that the Rotterdam Nucleus (referred to as the 'Pilot Case') is the leading scenario and as a result it is explored in more detail. The potential Pilot Case is based on the development of Rotterdam (in the Netherlands) as a southern North Sea hub. Under this Rotterdam Nucleus scenario, captured CO2 will be transported through the Port of Rotterdam to depleted gas fields offshore the Netherlands. CO2 will also be transported through further links using CCS infrastructure to facilitate the processing of undeveloped gas fields offshore UK. The Pilot case contemplates further expansion opportunities, increasing the capture clusters through additional pipelines, expanding to further gas fields and using the port of Rotterdam for CO2 shipping-hence the analysis of the other scenarios may be invaluable in the future development of CO2 networks in the EU. Finally, and an original contribution of this article is that it employs the three lawyers of energy law theoretical framework to an energy problem that was examined by an interdisciplinary research team. Furthermore, this research was developed further through two key industry stakeholder meetings with CCS experts in the EU.",,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8606383800506592,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
5222698,"The need for a Net Zero Principles Framework to support public policy at local, regional and national levels","Many nations have committed to midcentury net zero carbon emissions targets in line with the 2015 Paris Agreement. These require systemic transition in how people live and do business in different local areas and regions within nations. Indeed, in recognition of the climate challenge, many regional and city authorities have set their own net zero targets. What is missing is a grounded principles framework to support what will inevitably be a range of broader public policy actions, which must in turn consider pathways that are not only technically, but economically, socially and politically feasible. Here, we attempt to stimulate discussion on this issue. We do so by making an initial proposition around a set of generic questions that should challenge any decarbonisation action, using the example of carbon capture and storage to illustrate the importance and complexity of ensuring feasibility of actions in a political economy arena. We argue that this gives rise to five fundamental 'Net Zero Principles' around understanding of who really pays and gains, identifying pathways that deliver growing and equitable prosperity, some of which can deliver near-term economic returns, while avoiding outcomes that simply involve 'off-shoring' of emissions, jobs and gross domestic product.",Just transition; net zero; political economy; principles; public policy,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8603770136833191,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This article uses efforts toward greening the Mongstad oil refinery in Norway as a case to analyse the challenges involved in politically stimulated shifts towards increased sustainability in the energy sector. A technology test centre and a full-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) project at Mongstad were the centrepiece of the Stoltenberg government's (2005-2013) climate strategy. However, the project suffered delays and cost overruns until the full-scale carbon capture and storage project was eventually stopped. It is argued that interactions between the policy-making and industrial innovation arenas involved in this case are challenging because they operate according to different internal logics. We conceptualize this divergence as 'policy/industry dissonance' and suggest that this concept is a useful complement to literatures on regional innovation systems (RIS) and the multilevel perspective on sustainability transitions (MLP).",energy; policy; innovation; carbon capture and storage; dissonance,Article,2016.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8602380752563477,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1781200,Blurred Lines: The Ethics and Policy of Greenhouse Gas Removal at Scale,"The topic of Greenhouse Gas Removal (GGR) for climate geoengineering is becoming increasingly salient following the IPCC's 5th Assessment Report and the Paris Agreement. GGR is thought of as a separate category to mitigation techniques such as low-carbon supply or demand reduction, yet multiple social, ethical and acceptability concerns cut across categories. We propose moving beyond classifying climate strategies as a set of discrete categories (which may implicitly homogenize diverse technologies), toward a prioritization of questions of scale of both technology and decision-making in the examination of social and ethical risks. This is not just a theoretical issue: important questions for policy, governance and finance are raised, for instance over the future inclusion of GGR in carbon markets. We argue that the conclusions drawn about how best to categorize, govern and incentivize any strategy will depend on the framing used, because different framings could lead to very different policy recommendations being drawn. Because of this, a robust approach to developing, governing and financing GGR should pay attention first to urgent concerns regarding democracy, justice and acceptability.",geoengineering; greenhouse gas removal; ethics; acceptability; risk; policy,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8600075244903564,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5331118,A Framework for Operationalizing Climate-Just Ocean Commitments Under the Paris Agreement,"Building on the considerable momentum from the commencement of the Decade of Ocean Science, the Ocean-climate nexus will be center stage at COP26. Many countries are including blue carbon Ocean commitments in their second round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs), and there is a need to harmonize the science, law, and economics of Ocean-based climate mitigation and adaptation strategies to enable implementation of Ocean commitments under the Paris Agreement. In addition, consistent with the Paris Agreement preamble's focus on human rights, the rights and empowerment of vulnerable and marginalized communities, and intergenerational equity, the design and implementation of Ocean commitments in NDCs should be centered on considerations of climate justice (“climate-just Ocean commitments”). The challenges and opportunities inherent in implementing climate-just Ocean commitments require a comprehensive review of the latest innovations in blue carbon scientific research, the enabling conditions necessary for uptake of this science into policies and decision making, and the financial structures needed to equitably finance Ocean nature-based solutions. Responding to this need, we propose that a framework is needed to support the inclusion of blue carbon sequestration potential in ambitious national and subnational action. The proposed framework should center on the intersectionality of climate justice with the three key layers essential to implementation of Ocean commitments—science, law, and economics—where traditional and local ecological knowledge is valued on par with western science, law and policy centers on vulnerable communities, and financial mechanisms respect national sovereignty, value local cultures, and support sustainable economic development.

152731,The role of forests in global climate change: whence we come and where we go,"Neither the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) nor the Kyoto Protocol include a satisfying mechanism for reducing the substantial emissions from deforestation which are responsible for about a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. It is acknowledged that planting forests, for example through afforestation and reforestation in the Clean Development Mechanism, clearly provides an opportunity to sequester carbon in vegetation and soils. However, it takes decades to restore carbon stocks that have been lost as a result of land-use changes. Reducing the rate of deforestation is the only effective way to reduce carbon losses from forest ecosystems. As negotiations on a post-Kyoto agreement have already started the authors argue that a complete and fair post-Kyoto regime will have to expand existing regulations by creating a framework to encompass all land-use and forest-related changes in carbon stocks. Developing countries administer the majority of the world's environmental resources and provide a vital global public good by maintaining environmental assets. However, with increasing pressure on development and the use of resources, developing countries can hardly be expected to provide these services free. Therefore, they will have to be integrated into a more comprehensive incentive framework which also rewards forestry conservation, sustainable forest management and afforestation. The authors discuss how an incentive system for the protection of forests can be included in a future climate regime. Different design choices are considered and two recent approaches to reward developing countries that avoid further deforestation are compared: the 'compensated reduction of deforestation' approach and the Carbon Stock Approach.",,Article,2006.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8597556352615356,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
1993100,Towards net zero CO2 emissions without relying on massive carbon dioxide removal,"Current emission scenarios that allow keeping the global temperature increase below 2 °C or even 1.5 °C—as foreseen by the Paris Agreement—are based on very optimistic assumptions, including enormous volumes of carbon dioxide removal (CDR). A closer look at the globally most important emission sectors—power, transport and industry—shows manifold barriers for very ambitious mitigation. A new policy guideline called “Net Zero CO2 Emissions without relying on massive CDR” and promotion of technological research, in addition to economic incentives and other policy measures, would help to overcome the often simplistic demands for positive modelling results and refocus climate policy on tackling the enormous barriers in key emitting sectors. Such an approach is more aligned with the Paris Agreement’s bottom-up logic and therefore more appropriate to make the transformational project of global decarbonization a success. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Note,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8596246242523193,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

1783475,How carbon markets have influenced change in the Australian forest industries,"The influence of carbon markets on the current structure of the Australian forest industries is mostly evident in the emergence of 24 new entrepreneurial firms that are primarily engaged in the business of afforestation-based offsets. Whilst these firms currently account for only a small amount of business (in terms of financial turnover and area of tree plantings) compared with the traditional constituents of the Australian forest industries, their emergence is indicative of a changing strategic outlook for the industry in which carbon markets are likely to play a much more influential role. The authors argue that regulated carbon market policy should be designed to support the capacity of such entrepreneurial firms to engage in carbon markets, particularly in the early stages of the introduction of a mandatory emissions trading scheme and particularly how policy influences the entrepreneurial firms' capacity to secure finance.",markets; carbon; trade; industry; afforestation; plantations; policy; regulation; finance,Article,2010.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8592758178710938,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

In order to be viable, many CCS projects will have to be transboundary, in the sense that CO2 will be stored in a country other than from where it was captured. The most attractive, or even the only available, storage option is often offshore. However, export of CO2 for sub-seabed storage is prohibited as dumping by the 1996 London Protocol. An amendment to the Protocol that enables export was adopted in 2009, but is unlikely to enter into force.

A key governance challenge is operationalizing standards for the permanence of carbon sequestered in terrestrial and coastal ecosystems. There are multiple risks of reversal of carbon storage in these ecosystems and release of carbon back to the atmosphere. This paper reviews issues of permanence in four approaches for carbon removal focusing on carbon uptake and potential side-effects of long-term land commitments. Recognizing that permanence is a considerable barrier to large-scale application of land-based carbon removal, we argue that temporary carbon storage can still provide climate benefits in the short run. A multilateral governance framework should redefine permanence requirements and reflect principles of sustainability, polycentricity, and land stewardship.",,Review,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8587625622749329,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
653272,PROCEDURAL JUSTICE IN CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE,"This paper examines where and how claims of procedural injustice, or demands for procedural justice, might arise with respect to carbon capture and storage (CCS), taking a broad view of the CCS research, development and deployment process. It considers the principles that might govern such claims and seeks to identify where responsibility might lie for ensuring justice, or addressing contested claims of injustice. It is suggested that claims of procedural injustice arising from CCS are most likely to arise during implementation, from locally affected populations, raising concerns of inadequate information or consultation; but they may also arise from representatives of other indirectly affected groups, such as those affected by upstream impacts of coal mining, or energy market consequences of CCS policy. It is further suggested that claims are most likely to be directed at public authorities in respect of decisions over policy, strategy or authorisations for individual developments, but there are also routes by which claims may be directed at the corporations involved, especially under human rights provisions. The paper suggests a need for careful consideration of both procedural and, by implication, distributive justice matters in the emerging regulatory and support framework for CCS, with a particular imperative for moving public engagement upstream prior to deployment and indeed even to research programmes, to maximise the scope for legitimate influence on future outcomes.",,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8587108254432678,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1640668,World Bank CCS Program activities in South Africa - Results and lessons learned,"The World Bank Group (WB) Carbon Capture and Storage Trust Fund (CCS TF) was established in 2009 to support CO2 capture and storage (CCS) capacity and knowledge building in developing countries(dagger). This support is intended to create opportunities for the WB partner countries to explore their CCS potential and, if appropriate, to facilitate the inclusion of CCS options into their low-CO2 growth strategies and policies. Nine countries were selected in Phase 1 of the CCS TF support including South Africa. CCS TF Phase 1 support for CCS in South Africa included an allocation of US$ 1.35 million and had the objective of supporting the Government of South Africa by undertaking three specific studies : 1. The development of a regulatory framework for CCS in South Africa 2. A techno-economic review of CCS implementation in South Africa 3. The development of a national and local public engagement p lan for the South African Pilot CO2 Storage Project The South African Department of Energy (DoE) and the South African National Energy Development Institute (SANEDI) were the beneficiaries and counterparts for these WB supported CCS studies. The South Africa CCS Roadmap, developed by SANEDI and released in 2010, defined several milestones to understand and develop the potential for CCS in South Africa. The implementation of the Pilot Carbon Storage Project (PCSP) is planned as the next milestone in the Roadmap to be completed between 2017 and 2021. The PCSP scope includes the transport, geological storage and monitoring of between 10,000 and 50,000tCO(2), sourced from an industrial facility. The WB selected the Environmental Resources Management Southern Africa (ERM) as the lead consultant for the legal and regulatory assessment, undertaken in association with Carbon Counts and IMBEWU Sustainability Legal Specialists. The aim of the legal and regulatory assessment study was to review the existing legislation and regulation in South Africa to identify gaps and barriers for the authorisation and regulation of the PCSP with the view to informing the development of a CCS regulatory framework. The ERM consortium worked closely with the South African DoE and the Inter-Departmental CCS Task Team (IDTT), which was established in 2011 to inform, coordinate and promote the development of CCS in South Africa. The study recommended the following four options for regulating CCS in South Africa, using the existing regulations or a new regulatory framework: 1. The National Environmental Management: Waste Act (NEM: Waste Act). 2. The National Environmental Management Act (NEMA) 3. The NEMA and the Mineral Petroleum Resource Development Act (MPRDA). 4. The development of stand - alone legislation, specifically for the purposes of regulating CCS. The aim of the second study was to develop a detailed technical and economic analysis for large-scale development and deployment of CCS across South Africa's industrial installations by 2050. The WB lead consultant for the technical and economic analysis study, Parsons Brinckerhoff, reviewed and recorded CO2 sources and CO2 storage locations (as identified in the Atlas on Geological Storage of CO2 in South Africa) and conducted the subsequent analysis of how these sources and sink can be connected in the most cost effective way under varying roll-out scenarios. The analysis found that large-scale CCS could be deployed in South Africa at a levelized average cost of ZAR 422 per metric ton of CO2 across all industrial sectors. The study found that the capital up-front costs of this large-scale deployment were significant but could be mitigated by taking a phased approach to CO2 capture deployment. The aim of the public engagement study was to develop a comprehensive plan for raising public awareness, informing and engaging with various public stakeholders in South Africa, both at the national and local levels, on the CCS technology deployment and respective management of potential risk. The public engagement took into account international best practice as well as South African specific considerations. Specific aspects, addressed the study, included: Raising awareness of CCS as a possible climate change mitigation measure; Helping to develop an understanding of key concepts in the CCS technology, subsurface storage and key issues; Outlining the benefits and potential risks of demonstration and deployment of the CCS technology in South Africa; and Placing CCS in the context of South African climate change mitigation, energy production and use, coal use, resource development, job creation, amongst others. The WB selected SRK Consulting South Africa as the lead consultant for the study, in association with Finley - Greenberg, and the World Resources Institute (WRI), prepared National and Local Stakeholder Engagement Plans, which recommended that stakeholder engagement commence at the national level with government officials before proceeding in turn to the provincial, district municipal, and local municipal levels. Following the conclusion of these studies a number of lessons were learned with regard to: the involvement of relevant stakeholders in the scoping and delivery of studies; and, how results are communicated to maximise the impact of the work.

150968,Soil Carbon Sequestration in Grazing Lands: Societal Benefits and Policy Implications,"This forum manuscript examines the importance of grazing lands for sequestering soil organic carbon (SOC), providing societal benefits, and potential influences on them of emerging policies and legislation. Global estimates are that grazing lands occupy similar to 3.6 billion ha and account for about one-fourth of potential carbon (C) sequestration in world soils. They remove the equivalent of similar to 20% of the carbon dioxide (CO2) released annually into the earth's atmosphere from global deforestation and land-use changes. Atmospheric CO2 enters grazing lands soils through photosynthetic assimilation by green plants, subsequent cycling, and sequestration of some of that C as SOC to in turn contribute to the ability of grazing lands to provide societal (environmental and economic) benefits in every country where they exist. Environmental benefits provided include maintenance and well-being of immediate and surrounding soil and water resources, air quality, human and wildlife habitat, and esthetics. Grazing lands contribute to the economic well-being of those living on the land, to trade, and to exchange of goods and services derived from them at local, regional, or national levels. Rates of SOC sequestration vary with climate, soil, and management; examples and conditions selected from US literature illustrate the SOC sequestration that might be achieved.

1905573,Carbon Dioxide Removal after Paris,"Notwithstanding adoption of the Paris Agreement on climate change, mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions appears unlikely to achieve the stated goal of limiting the mean global temperature increase to 2 degrees C. Under many scenarios, achieving this goal would require not only vigorous mitigation efforts, but also the deployment of carbon dioxide removal technologies or solar geoengineering. While serious consideration of solar geoengineering remains fraught with peril, the use of carbon dioxide removal to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it elsewhere appears increasingly likely. Carbon dioxide removal techniques generally would have to be undertaken on a massive scale to be effective. However, the techniques are not ready for deployment, and their widespread use would impact land use, biodiversity, food security, water availability, and other resources. Such impacts demand greater attention to managing carbon dioxide removal efforts and their effects. The Paris Agreement does not directly mention carbon dioxide removal, however, and relatively little attention has been directed toward carbon dioxide removal governance thus far. This Article explores key issues of carbon dioxide removal governance, such as promoting the generation of information, mainstreaming carbon dioxide removal into public and policy discussions, and furthering carbon dioxide removal development while avoiding lock-in of suboptimal technologies.",,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.858263373374939,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
310222,CLIMATE POLICY: SEPARATING FACT FROM FANTASY,"There is widespread agreement that climate change is a serious problem. If nations fail to regulate greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, or use alternative strategies for addressing the problem, the damages could be significant, and perhaps catastrophic. In this Essay, I argue that the range of effective options to address this problem is likely to be quite limited for the foreseeable future. The primary reason is that national leaders appear to lack the political will to achieve global emission reductions in a timely, manner. This observation does not mean that we should do nothing. It does mean that we should focus on what is likely to be sensible and doable. I argue that it makes little sense to try to bring all countries into a binding international agreement to reduce emissions at this time, because such agreements are not likely to be workable. It makes sense, instead, for interested countries to take some action now to limit greenhouse gas emissions, including putting a price on emissions. It also makes sense to focus on research and development - including how best to adapt to climate change, improve our understanding of geoengineering, and improve the cost effectiveness of carbon capture. In addition, countries should continue to experiment with institutions that will be needed to manage a portfolio of solutions for addressing climate change over the longer term.

104514,Understanding the implications of emerging soil carbon land use policies for surface mining in the United Kingdom,"The objective of this paper is to examine the implications and opportunities the emerging soil carbon and land use policies have for the surface mining industry. Policies for the protection and sustainable use of natural soils in the UK have evolved from a simple land capability reinstatement focus of the later decades of the 20th Century to the current and new concepts of ecosystem service impacts for land use planning and assessment. Ecosystem services include the diverse role of soils as well as their adaptive response to climate change and mitigation, soil health and sustainable food production. Of the various foci, soil carbon has been in the recent forefront of UK soil policy development, albeit it largely a matter of principle and aspiration in conserving the carbon stock in soils to avoid contributing further to the greenhouse gas inventory. However, at the present time, the evidence base is believed to be incomplete for full and reliable technical based guidance in the UK. In respect of carbon rich organic soils there is clearer and specific guidance. This has arisen, not through surface mining, but largely through wind farm developments (for sustainable energy generation terms of carbon net benefit), and review of farming and forestation practices on carbon rich soils (that are typically associated with both the UK's windier uplands and low lying coastal land). In terms of surface mining, the current guidance is limited to the exposure of former underground coal workings where a formula is given to offset the emission of methane through tree planting. However, it is anticipated, as general land use policy develops alongside a growing evidence base, that specific guidance and operational expectations will be forthcoming. This may be an opportunity for the mining industry to respond with its own innovative proposals.",,Conference Paper,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8580791354179382,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Change in the existing policy structure is, however, unlikely because of cultural lock-in, including the institutional and psychological commitments of many participants to the current process. Accordingly, there may be increased pressures to develop geoengineering technologies, intended to reduce anthropogenic climate change by either capturing atmospheric CO2, or reducing solar insolation.

462882,Integrating agriculture and climate change mitigation at landscape scale: Implications from an Australian case study,"Rural and regional hinterlands provide the ecosystem service needs for increasingly urbanised communities across the globe. These inter-related ecosystem services provide key opportunities in securing climate change mitigation and adaptation. Their integrated management in the face of climate change, however, can be confounded by fragmentation within the complex institutional arrangements concerned with natural resource management. This suggests the need for a more systemic approach to continuous improvement in the integrated and adaptive governance of natural resources. This paper explores the theoretical foundations for integrated natural resource management and reviews positive systemic improvements that have been emerging in the Australian context. In setting clear theoretical foundations, the paper explores both functional and structural aspects of natural resource governance systems. Functional considerations include issues of connectivity, knowledge use and capacity within the natural resource decision making environment. Structural considerations refer to the institutions and processes that undertake planning through to implementation, monitoring and evaluation. From this foundation, we review the last decade of emerging initiatives in governance regarding the integration of agriculture and forests across the entire Australian landscape. This includes the shift towards more devolved regional approaches to integrated natural resource management and recent progress towards the use of terrestrial carbon at landscape scale to assist in climate change mitigation and adaptation. These developments, however, have also been tempered by a significant raft of new landscape-scale regulations that have tended to be based on a more centralist philosophy that landowners should be providing ecosystem services for the wider public good without substantive reward. Given this background, we explore a case study of efforts taken to integrate the management of landscape-scale agro-ecological services in the Wet Tropics of tropical Queensland. This is being achieved primarily through the integration of regional natural resource management planning and the development of aggregated terrestrial carbon offset products at a whole of landscape scale via the Degree Celsius initiative. Finally, the paper teases out the barriers and opportunities being experienced, leading to discussion about the global implications for managing climate change, income generation and poverty reduction.

303124,The green paradox: Why one may not forget the offer in the climate policy,"Despite its efforts and obligations under the Kyoto Protocol, the EU has not succeeded in even making a dent in the rapidly rising trend of worldwide carbon dioxide emissions. If anything, the trend has accelerated in recent years. In his Tḧunen Lecture given to the Verein f̈ur Socialpolitik in October 2007, the author criticizes the attempt to slow down global warming by means of unilaterally curtailing the demand for fossil fuels and develops an intertemporal supply side approach to the economics of global warming. He advances the hypothesis that the ineffectiveness of demand policies results from anticipation effects on the part of the owners of fossil fuel resources. In addition to the threat of potential ousting by domestic rivals, the threat of falling energy prices (against a modified Hotelling trend) due to greening public policies and increasing participation in worldwide emissions trading systems gives resource owners the incentive to speed up extraction. Feasible policy measures that do not encounter such problematic anticipation effects include the rapid creation of a complete worldwide monopsony for fossil fuels that can dictate quantities rather than having to rely on price signals. Moreover, source taxes on the financial returns of resource owners will provide additional conservation motives; technical measures including afforestation and sequestration may also be a way to reduce the speed of global warming. © 2008 der Autor.",,Article,2008.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8568105697631836,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

4927571,Farming with Trees: Reforming US Farm Policy to Expand Agroforestry and Mitigate Climate Change,"Agroforestry systems have enormous potential to mitigate climate change. These systems incorporate trees and shrubs into agricultural production, increasing both soil carbon sequestration and the amount of carbon stored in biomass. Even the most conservative estimates find that agroforestry sequesters two to five times more carbon per acre than the most effective-and betterknown-climate-friendly practices for annual crops, such as no-till agriculture and cover crops. Agroforestry also offers substantial environmental and economic benefits: clean water, reduced fertilizer and pesticide use, greater resiliency, and higher profitability per acre. Yet there are significant legal and policy barriers to its expansion in the United States. For the first time in the policy literature, this Article reviews the emerging scientific research on agroforestry. The Article then analyzes how federal programs for agricultural loans, subsidies, research, and education favor annual monocultures over agroforestry practices.

293320,The integration of biodiversity and climate change: A contextual assessment of the carbon farming initiative,"The Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI) allows the creation of tradable Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) derived from across the ecosystem sector via project-level baseline and credit activities: it is the first national offset scheme in the world to broadly include farming and forestry projects. Because these activities have the potential to produce both biodiversity and climate change benefits, a crucial outcome is for widespread uptake of the policy. However, the design, complexity and cost of the CFI project development process, and low prices as a result of ACCUs trading in the voluntary market, will all likely militate against this. This article shows how international politics and policy surrounding the Kyoto Protocol have influenced the design of the CFI, with its potential to proliferate complex and narrow methodologies and counter-productive approaches to integrity standards such as permanence. The article shows that despite the pressing need to integrate biodiversity and climate change considerations as equally important challenges, their global integration remains poorly articulated. Biodiversity considerations are also not integrated into the CFI but, rather, are dealt with indirectly through safeguard measures that avoid perverse incentives and unintended harm, and as an optional co-benefit via the development of an index. This article suggests that we need to move past the shackles of Kyoto towards streamlined and standardized approaches such as risk-based assessments and the use of regional baselines. Using regionally specific baselines such as for avoided deforestation would allow landholders to opt-in to regional-scale mitigation opportunities. Activities that Australia accounts for, such as reforestation and deforestation, should also be able to opt-in for coverage under the Clean Energy Act (and out of the voluntary carbon market) to obtain a secure price. © 2012 Ecological Society of Australia.",,JOUR,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.856395959854126,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
762901,Conflicts over carbon capture and storage in international climate governance,"In the Paris Agreement, ambitious emission targets are accompanied by insufficient mitigation measures. It lacks, in particular, strategies on how to reduce the use of fossil fuels. In this context the distinctive prospect of carbon capture and storage (CCS) - reducing emissions, albeit using fossil fuels on a large scale is of particular interest. CCS technologies promise to solve the climate problem independent of drawn-out political disputes and without changing production and consumption patterns. Conflicts about CCS put the fundamental debate on the agenda, whether a comprehensive transformation of social structures is (un-)necessary and (un-)desired in order to solve the ecological crisis. Therefore, in this paper CCS-conflicts are analyzed with a broader perspective including their effects on general struggles about international climate governance. The key research question is to what extent established social practices and structures become politicized - i.e. challenged. Based on the presented empirical findings, I discuss two theses: First, that the future of climate governance is contingent on decisions about the continued use of fossil fuels. Second, that CCS-conflicts have an explosive force that could lead to massive cracks within the paradigm of ecological modernization and thus could politicize international climate policy.",Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Climate governance; Climate politics; Ecological modernization; Fossil fuels; Techno-fix,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8562862277030945,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1793910,Assessing a Liability Regime for Carbon Capture and Storage,"As the private sector and government begin to spend billions of dollars to research and deploy carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, the question of legal liability for managing short-term and long-term environmental, health and safety risks must be addressed. We examine potential CCS liability within a U. S. context and survey the existing environmental and tort law liability regimes that may affect CCS. We conclude that while existing liability regimes are insufficient on their own to govern the CCS industry, they could provide important risk management tools and serve as safeguards to private parties and governments in the event of harm. We also propose a model for long term stewardship, blending including bonding, insurance, and pooled federal funding into commercial CCS project management to better provide financial security to investors without destroying existing liability protections for those who may suffer harm from CCS. This proposal offers a starting point to develop a model to integrate liability for the nascent CCS industry. A longer version of this paper can be found in the Emory Law Review, Fall 2008.

Agroforestry has been promoted in the last decades at global level as it provides more efficient and sustainable farming systems. This review aims at summarizing the main research findings explaining why agroforestry is a sustainable land management that fulfils and is affected by different Global, Pan-European and European policies as well as how innovation is currently fostered in Europe, therefore linking research, policy and innovation. This review specially targets researchers and policy makers working in integrated land systems. There is a global and European recognition of the role that agroforestry can play to provide products but also to deliver highly important ecosystem services. However, the promotion of agroforestry practices at European level is still not well addressed by the Common Agricultural Policy. The clear identification of agroforestry practices, the link of management plans to establish agroforestry pursuing a final eligible tree density for the Pillar I payments should be addressed as initial steps to foster agroforestry in Europe.

1868244,The foreign policy of carbon sinks: Carbon capture and storage as foreign policy in Norway,"Norway is among a handful of countries with an explicit policy to promote carbon capture and storage (CCS) at both national and international levels. This paper investigates the internal and external driving forces behind Norway's efforts to advance CCS as a global climate change mitigation option. The ambition is twofold: First, a mapping of Norway's public CCS policy with emphasis on the externally directed efforts is offered based on interviews and document studies. Second, it is explained how CCS foreign policy was chosen as a prioritized means of climate change mitigation policy in Norway. The study is conducted with the application of Foreign Policy Analysis. From the outside-in perspective, the international climate regime is emphasized. From the inside-out perspective, bureaucratic politics is in focus. It is found that the winning coalition behind the domestic CCS agenda also directed CCS foreign policy design and implementation. The CCS foreign policy offers a means to fulfil Norway's regime obligations on terms that harmonize the potential conflict of maintaining a political economy reliant on petroleum exports with a credible climate change mitigation policy. It is shown how technology R&D for global use has been a key ingredient in this context. It is also explored how the CCS foreign policy was materialized with the means of official development assistance and other funding mechanisms. (C) 2014 The Authors.

1838507,Regulating a Pilot Project in the Absence of Legislation Specific to Carbon Storage,"The CO2CRC Otway Project was initiated in 2004 as a first of a kind pilot project when there was no legislation for regulating Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) activities. After much deliberations on how this project was going to be regulated in 2006 and the preparation of documents for regulatory approvals in late 2006 and 2007, the project came into operation in April 2008 with approval from three key authorities. This paper sets out the journey of how the Otway Project, a pilot carbon storage project, was approved in the absence of legislation specific to regulating carbon storage. It covers the challenges of getting a pilot project approved through government including: managing timelines and resources; clarifying the regulatory framework for a pilot project: ensuring that the project approvals are fit for purpose; engaging the right authorities in the project approvals processes; allowing adequate time and resources for land access negotiations; allowing for continuation of pilot projects with the development of new legislation; resolving project responsibilities and long-term liability prior to project commencement; and taking a proactive approach to stakeholder engagement including engaging the media. The Project presented many challenges along the way but these were worked through between the Cooperative Research Centre for Greenhouse Gas Technologies (CO2CRC), the operator of the Project and the Victorian Government. With lateral thinking on the regulators' part and sheer perseverance of project facilitators in Victorian Goverment, the Project was delivered putting Victoria on the map as a State making an important contribution to advancing research into greenhouse gas geological storage.

With marine geoengineering based upon placement of matter in the marine environment, the London Protocol has decided that such activities fall under its scope. It has considered and prohibited ocean fertilization except for research purposes only, and a procedure is provided for new marine geoengineering activities to be considered. For both activities, detailed guidance is provided on the assessments and conditions for issuing of permits. (C) 2014 The Authors.

35848,The politics of climate change in Germany: ambition versus lobby power,"In 30 years of climate policy in Germany, a high level of declared ambition has coexisted with an eclectic mix of climate policy measures. Well-organized lobbies were either exempt from policy instruments such as the energy tax or directly benefitted from them, as in the case of the renewable feed-in tariff or windfall profits from free allocation of emissions allowances. As a result, German emissions mitigation is much more costly than it would have to be. Moreover, the challenges because of the imminent phase-out of nuclear power are increasing due to failures in a number of relevant policy fields such as offshore wind, grid reinforcement, and carbon capture and storage (CCS).

2498491,Climate Change Mitigation: from Carbon Cycle to Policy,"Climate change can be mitigated simultaneously by two ways, maintaining the greenhouse gases below the carbon budget and conserving marine and terrestrial vegetation for carbon sequestration. Marine vegetation (e.g. mangrove and seagrass meadows) is less than 0.5% of the total marine area and narrower compared to terrestrial vegetation. However, marine vegetation has high net primary production (NPP) and contributes more than 50% of the global carbon burial in its substrate and biomass. Indonesia has 3,301,848 ha of mangrove area, the widest in South-East Asia. The seagrass meadows of Indonesia are 150,693 ha, the second widest seagrass area in the world. These two ecosystems are important for the global carbon cycle due to their high capacity for carbon sequestration. Considering this potential, it is necessary to promote a strategic scientific-based policy of conservation of marine vegetation areas for both local and national stakeholders. The policies consist of: 1) to implement the National/Local Action Plan for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions (RAN/D GRK); 2) to manage the land use changes that contribute 67% of total national emissions; 3) to determine coastal ecosystem protection areas that are considering the province policy in the Plan for Zoning of Coastal Areas and Small Islands (RZWP3K); 4) to rehabilitate terrestrial vegetation, coastal ecosystems, and aquatic conservation areas (President Regulation no 61/2011); and 5) to strictly carry out the national policy for green open space (Government Regulation no 26/2008).",carbon cycle; climate change; coastal; ecosystems; policy; terrestrial,Proceedings Paper,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8557214140892029,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

According to UNFCCC, REDD is a multilevel activity that involves both national policy and structures, as well as subnational projects involving local communities [1]. While many Asian nations are trying to create frameworks that link the national strategy to sub-national projects, in India this formal integration has yet to take place. As a consequence projects like the Khasi Hills Community REDD+ project fall outside the UNFCCC strategy and operate under voluntary standards (Plan Vivo) and markets. The project involves both avoided deforestation and reforestation components. The project is being implemented by a federation of ten Khasi tribal kingdoms, a major ethnolinguistic group in the Indian state of Meghalaya. Project experience may provide guidance regarding actions required to create a more enabling environment for community forest carbon projects in Asia. These findings may better inform the December 2015 21st UNFCCC Conference of Parties in Paris as they again address REDD strategy. The experience of this Khasi Federation [2] in designing and implementing a REDD project has led to the emergence of a modernizing forest management system that is helping to conserve and restore the Khasi's ancestral forests. Learning from this REDD project also illustrates the barriers that the Khasi communities have faced, including those imposed by national governments, certifiers, and carbon markets, that will likely constrain the expansion and replication of community-based climate initiatives.

105515,Climate change and international deforestation: Legislative analysis,"Deforestation accounts for nearly 20% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Deforestation results in carbon emissions when trees and underlying vegetation are burning or decomposing. Deforested areas that are later cultivated also release carbon to the atmosphere when soil carbon is oxidized. Further, deforested areas converted to other land uses (e.g., pastures) might sequester less carbon than forests, enabling greater levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. Providing incentives to prevent deforestation in foreign countries has been proposed in climate change legislation. An objective of this legislation is to provide funding from carbon markets to assist foreign countries in reducing deforestation and increasing forest restoration and afforestation. Challenges to this approach include implementing deforestation reduction activities in developing countries that may lack the capacity to monitor and enforce measures, avoiding harm to indigenous communities who rely on forest resources, and matching policies with the various drivers of deforestation in different regions around the world. Legislative policies on deforestation and climate change are analyzed in this report, and challenges for restoring forests in the tropics are discussed. Deforestation1 is responsible for the largest share of additional carbon dioxide (CO2) released to the atmosphere due to land use changes, approximately 20% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually.2 Deforestation results in carbon emissions when trees and underlying vegetation are burning or decomposing. Deforested areas that are later cultivated also release carbon to the atmosphere when soil carbon is oxidized. Further, deforested areas converted to other land uses (e.g., pastures) might sequester less carbon than forests, enabling greater levels of CO2 in the atmosphere. Forests store approximately 45% of terrestrial carbon, and in the 1990s were estimated to remove 2.6 billion tons of carbon (mtCO2) from the atmosphere per year; this sequestered amount is equivalent to approximately 33% of anthropogenic carbon emissions from fossil fuel and land use changes.3 Data on carbon sequestration and emissions are not available for many regions, making global estimates uncertain. Much of the deforestation responsible for CO2 releases occurs in tropical regions, specifically in developing countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Tropical forests store approximately 25% of the total global terrestrial carbon. Scientists estimate that tropical deforestation and other land use changes may have been responsible for releasing approximately 1.5 billion metric tons of CO2 per year to the atmosphere during the 1990s, and may be contributing similar amounts of carbon to the atmosphere today.4 Some contend that deforestation due to logging might result in small carbon emissions because timber converted into products will not release CO2 immediately. Others disagree, stating that the percentage of wood transformed into wood products is probably small in tropical and temperate regions. Deforestation rates vary across the world, yet are generally higher in tropical regions (see Figure 1). By continent, the highest rate of net forest loss is in South America, which lost approximately 4.3 million hectares (ha) of its forest (0.5%) annually from 2000 to 2005. This is followed by Africa, which lost approximately 4.0 million ha (0.6%) of its forest annually during the same period. North America (including Central America), in contrast, lost approximately 333,000 ha (0.05%) annually from 2000-2005; and in China, there was a reported gain of 4.1 million ha of forest annually (2.2%) during the same period, primarily due to large-scale afforestation efforts.5 © 2010 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

1860459,Balancing the Risks: Choosing Climate Alternatives,"Very aggressive reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are needed over the next ten years to avoid a ""planet on fire."" Current sub-national, national and international policy assumes that carbon sequestration, biofuels, nuclear power, ocean fertilization, atmospheric aerosols, and other such technologies, which heretofore have been considered too novel or too dangerous to use, will have to be deployed at large scale, globally. Moving forward with promising technologies that might preserve us from the consequences of global warming will be difficult because they also pose potential hazards, promise uncertain benefits, and in some cases are already burdened with restrictive legislation and poor public image. The lack of a rational process of risk assessment and public decision making is likely to lead to a poor long-term outcome. Moreover, the standard administrative and political processes used to assess such risks can take years, time that we do not have. Principled and practical policymaking demand citizens participate in the decision to develop and use these novel technologies. Environmental assessment, horizon scanning, and new research on human and organizational factors suggest techniques to improve technology development decisions.",,Proceedings Paper,2009.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8553325533866882,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

To prepare for this risk, some scientists have started to explore techniques that directly influence or control global and regional climatic systems to offset climate change effects. As climate engineering research expands, U.S. environmental law could become an important forum for efforts to control nascent climate engineering technologies. Federal and state agencies should start now to map out regulatory strategies and guidance for potential requests to authorize climate engineering experiments or to control objectionable projects. Climate engineering will also offer an unprecedented test of the scope of federal judicial power and the institutional competence of U.S. courts to review environmental projects designed to have a global impact. Prior climate change tort actions have tested the ability of courts to ascribe responsibility or assign liabilities to individual parties for damages caused by widely dispersed global activities. Climate engineering presents the mirror image of climate change public nuisance actions: rather than affixing responsibility for a share of a global phenomenon, lawsuits against climate engineering projects can pursue a clearly identifiable small number of parties who expressly and intentionally attempt to create global climate effects. To properly decide these disputes, federal courts in particular will need to understand how cornerstone U.S. environmental laws and key doctrines, including political question, standing, causation, and preemption and displacement, apply to global climate remediation projects.",,Article,2011.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8547163009643555,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Planetary-scale intervention carries the potential for planetary-scale risk. Continued emissions of greenhouse gases represent an unintentional planetary-scale human intervention in the climate system, which is resulting in global consequences that will become increasingly harmful to both human and environmental systems. The most appropriate response to this problem is to decrease the level of overall human intervention in the climate system by decreasing greenhouse gas emissions. However, owing to the slow progress of mitigation efforts, many scientists are starting to suggest alternate climate interventions as a strategy to decrease or avert some of the anticipated impacts of global warming. In this review, I will consider the role of some forms of climate intervention those aimed at accelerating the slow natural removal of atmospheric CO, as possible complements to aggressive mitigation policy, for the purpose of expanding the range of attainable long-term climate targets.",,Review,2010.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8546658754348755,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) may be the solution enabling Poland to continue of use of coal, as available fuel, and at the same time, allowing for substantial reduction of CO(2) emissions. In the European Union, the Climate and Energy Package was established, aimed at creating proper conditions for CO(2) reduction in energy and industry sectors. Directive on carbon transport and storage (CCS Directive) is a part of the abovementioned Package. CCS may be a promising technology particularly for Poland, where more than 90% of energy is produced from fossil fuels. In this article, issues regarding EU legal framework of CCS is presented.

Methodology: The research approach was qualitative, exploratory and descriptive, based on documental and bibliographic analysis on the subject. Relevance: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an emerging technology to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere and thus mitigate climate change. There is a need for government planning to meet Brazil's commitments under the Paris Agreement, in which context the use of CCS can be assessed as a strategy for the country. Results: The results have shown that the viability of CCS projects is often linked to a strong public policy to support the technology and that it will possibly be dependent on the political will of the government to implement them on a large scale. Contributions: Analysis of possible approaches to CCS funding in Brazil, also examining possible associations between this technology and some Brazilian sectors, such as oil and gas, bioenergy and cement. Conclusion: In Brazil, although currently CCS is exclusively associated with the oil and gas sector, this technology can be considered for other sectors as a form of compliance of Brazilian NDCs. © 2021 Universidade Nove de Julho-UNINOVE.

This suggests that the interest in, and viability of, large-scale deployment of CCS in developing countries has to be analyzed as a strategic issue in the overall context of national development. But what are then the strategic concerns that may influence developing countries' decisions to pursue large-scale deployment of CCS technology?

68864,Carbon capture and storage: pulling down the barriers in the European Union,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one of the number of approaches to mitigating climate change by reducing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere. It involves capturing carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from large point sources such as power plants, prior to compressing, transporting, and storing it securely in geological formations. The CO(2) emitted is thus prevented from entering the atmosphere. CCS is believed, by many, to have massive potential to significantly reduce GHG emissions, with the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change suggesting that CCS could contribute between 10 and 55 per cent of the world's total carbon mitigation effort until 2100. This article considers the principal impediments to the development of CCS projects and the steps taken in the European Union (EU) to overcome them. The development of CCS requires not only the establishment of adequate funding mechanisms and, most likely, the existence of consistently higher carbon prices than those prevail today, but also the settlement of a number of key legal issues. Although much further work is required on the part of legislators, a regulatory framework for CCS is slowly growing in various jurisdictions, especially in the EU where a large step forward was taken in December 2008 with the passing of a CCS Directive.",CO(2); capture; storage; legal; regulatory; issues,Article,2009.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8539304733276367,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

These outcomes can be explained by specific design features in the program that placed large-scale projects at a disadvantage, and by the wider context of EU climate and energy policies providing inadequate market-pull incentives for CCS and biofuels.

1299285,Agroforestry development in Europe: Policy issues,"Agroforestry is considered a sustainable form of land management that optimizes the use of natural resources (nutrients, radiation, water). Agroforestry is defined as the deliberate integration of woody vegetation with agricultural activities in the lower story. It provides a higher biomass production per unit of land, while providing more ecosystem services than woody-less agricultural lands, such as the reduction of soil erosion and nitrogen leaching, and increase carbon sequestration and landscape biodiversity. The objective of this paper is to evaluate the past and current European Union Common Agricultural policies aiming at promoting the afforestation or reforestation of lands, as the introduction of trees can be seen as a first step to carry out agroforestry practices in former agricultural or forest lands. Agroforestry was a traditional land use system in Europe before modern times. However, before the sixties land intensification and consolidation destroyed millions of trees all over Europe. On the contrary, some good examples of agroforestry promotion are found in Eastern European countries in order to reduce the effect of extreme events such as winds, flooding at the beginning and mid of the last century. In Western European countries, the introduction of trees in the land has been promoted by agroforestry, afforestation and reforestation at the end of the last century. Afforestation of agricultural lands have been the most successful CAP measure (over 1 million hectares) while agroforestry measures were not extensively adopted which may be explained by the funds associated to afforestation measure which compensated the losses of income 15 or 20 years in afforested lands. Agroforestry was poorly adopted in the CAP 2007-2013, having a better success in the CAP 2014-2020 due to the recognition of woody vegetation and the compensation of 5 years given for maintenance once agroforestry is established. However, policy rules ensuring Pillar I payment when agroforestry measure is adopted such as a management plans ensuring that maximum tree density (100 trees per hectare) is not reached, should be pursued.",CAP; Pillar I; Pillar II; Sustainability; Measure 222,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8524258136749268,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
4984571,Incentivizing BECCS—A Swedish Case Study,"Negative carbon dioxide (CO2)-emissions are prevalent in most global emissions pathways that meet the Paris temperature targets and are a critical component for reaching net-zero emissions in Year 2050. However, economic incentives supporting commercialization and deployment of BioEnergy Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) are missing. This Policy and Practice Review discusses five different models for creating incentives and financing for BECCS, using Sweden as an example: (1) governmental guarantees for purchasing BECCS outcomes; (2) quota obligation on selected sectors to acquire BECCS outcomes; (3) allowing BECCS credits to compensate for hard-to-abate emissions within the EU ETS; (4) private entities for voluntary compensation; and (5) other states acting as buyers of BECCS outcomes to meet their mitigation targets under the Paris Agreement. We conclude that successful implementation of BECCS is likely to require a combination of several of the Policy Models, implemented in a sequential manner. The governmental guarantee model (Model 1) is likely to be required in the shorter term, so as to establish BECCS. Policy Models 2 and 3 may become more influential over time once BECCS has been established and accepted. Model 3 links BECCS to a large carbon-pricing regime with opportunities for cost-effectiveness and expanded financing. We conclude that Policy Models 4 and 5 are associated with high levels of uncertainty regarding the timing and volume of negative emissions that can be expected—Thus, they are unlikely to trigger BECCS implementation in the short term, although may have roles in the longer term. Based on this study, we recommend that policymakers carefully consider a policy sequencing approach that is predictable and sustainable over time, for which further analyses are required. It is not obvious how such sequencing can be arranged, as the capacities to implement the different Policy Models are vested in different organizations (national governments, EU, private firms). Furthermore, it is important that a BECCS policy is part of an integrated climate policy framework, in particular one that is in line with policies aimed at the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the creation of a circular economy. It will be important to ensure that BECCS and the associated biomass resource are not overexploited. A well-designed policy package should guarantee that BECCS is neither used to postpone the reduction of fossil fuel-based emissions nor overused in the short term as a niche business for “greenwashing” while not addressing fossil fuel emissions.

629697,Regulation of the nexus,"The climate-energy-water nexus is a relatively new focus of interdisciplinary research and policy attention (Proust et al 2007; WBCSD 2010; PMSEIC 2010; Water in the West 2013). Research and practice regarding regulation of the nexus is at an even more nascent stage. Nevertheless, regulation - establishing rules, laws, and institutional and decision-making frameworks - is emerging as a critical dimension of managing the trade-offs that arise at the intersection of climate, energy and water policies. On the one hand, well-designed regulation that takes account of all elements of the nexus can facilitate more integrated decision making and management, in some cases leading to outcomes that optimise benefits for all three sectors (Pittock et al. 2013). On the other hand, regulatory systems in different sectors that operate independently of one another - a situation described as “regulatory fragmentation” (Craig 2008) - may present barriers to management of the nexus and to the implementation of innovative technological options. This chapter examines regulation of the climate-energy-water nexus. It focusses on the barriers to integrated climate-energy-water decision making posed by regulatory fragmentation, as well as case examples of ways that existing regulatory frameworks for climate, energy and water might be adapted to better manage the nexus. Case studies are drawn from specific jurisdictional contexts - Australia, the United States and the European Union - but are analysed as examples of regulatory practice that might offer useful lessons for regulation of the nexus in other regions and countries. The final section of the chapter considers some of the new challenges facing regulatory efforts at the nexus. These include current or imminent developments: for example, the climate change and water impacts of efforts to harvest ‘unconventional’ energy resources, including through the use of techniques of hydraulic fracturing (fracking) (Wiseman 2009; NWC 2010). Other challenges lie on the horizon: for example, the water and energy implications of proposed technologies to deal with carbon pollution and climate change, such as carbon capture and storage (Pittock et al 2013), or geoengineering (Royal Society 2009). © Jamie Pittock, Karen Hussey and Stephen Dovers 2015.",,Book Chapter,2015.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.852016270160675,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
101186,Legal and regulatory challenges in the implementation of CO2 geological storage: An Alberta and Canadian perspective,"Alberta is the province with the largest CO2 emissions in Canada, with approximately two-thirds of emissions originating from large stationary sources. Due to the fortuitous association of large CO2 sources with the storage capacity offered by the underlying Alberta basin, it is expected that large-scale CO2 geological storage in Canada will occur in Alberta first, and both levels of governments are contemplating measures to facilitate implementation. A review of the current provincial and federal legislation and regulations presented in this paper indicates that the existing legal and regulatory regime is reasonably sufficient, with some modifications, to accommodate the active injection phase of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) operations, and the early takers of this new technology. However, governments in Alberta and Canada, and likely everywhere, need to address several pressing issues dealing mainly with the CCS post-operational phase. These issues, reviewed in this paper from an Alberta and Canadian perspective, fall into several categories: jurisdictional, property (ownership), regulatory and liability. Because Alberta is a landlocked province, matters relating to CO2 storage under the seabed will not be addressed here except when discussing matters of jurisdiction and CO2 classification. Possible models for post-injection liability transfer to the state are also presented. Although this review is focused on western Canada conditions, the issues are broad enough to be of interest in other jurisdictions, which may also adopt parts of the legal and regulatory framework that is quite well developed in Alberta.

496885,Aligning climate change mitigation and agricultural policies in eastern Europe and central Asia,"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are largely determined by howenergy is created and used, and policies designed to encourage mitigation efforts reflect this reality. An unintended consequence of an energy-focused strategy is that the set of policy instruments needed to tap mitigation opportunities in agriculture is incomplete. In particular, market-linked incentives to achieve mitigation targets are disconnected from efforts to better manage carbon sequestered in agricultural land. This is especially important for many countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) where once-productive land has been degraded through poor agricultural practices. Often good agricultural policies and prudent natural resource management can compensate for missing links to mitigation incentives, but only partially.At the same time, two international project-based programs, Joint Implementation (JI) and the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), have been used to finance other types of agricultural mitigation effortsworldwide. However, a reviewof projects suggests that fewECAcountries take full advantage of these financing paths. This chapter discusses mitigation opportunities in the region, the reach of current mitigation incentives, and missed mitigation opportunities in agriculture. The chapter concludes with a discussion of alternative policies designed to jointly promote mitigation and co-benefits for agriculture and the environment. © 2015 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

1880230,"Geoengineering: rights, risks and ethics","This article discusses arguments that manipulating the Earth's climate may provoke unforeseen, unintended and uncontrollable consequences that threaten human rights. The risks arise from both main types of geoengineering: solar radiation management (SRM) techniques and carbon dioxide removal (CDR). SRM creates particular risks because it is difficult to test on a wide scale and may not be capable of being recalled after deployment. Adequate, enforceable governance structures do not currently exist to assess and regulate the risks of climate engineering, not least whether such technologies can be terminated in the absence of significant emissions reductions. This article is divided into six sections. After the opening introductory section, section 2 discusses the links between climate change and human rights.

331971,The promise of carbon capture and storage: evaluating the capture-readiness of new EU fossil fuel power plants,"To what degree are recently built and planned power plants in the EU 'capture-ready' for carbon capture and storage (CCS)? Survey results show that most recently built fossil fuel power plants have not been designed as capture-ready. For 20 planned coal-fired plants, 13 were said to be capture-ready (65%). For 31 planned gas-fired power plants, only 2 were indicated to be capture-ready (6%). Recently built or planned power plants are expected to cover a large share of fossil fuel capacity by 2030 and thereby have a large impact on the possibility to implement CCS after 2020. It is estimated that around 15-30% of fossil fuel capacity by 2030 can be capture-ready or have CO(2) capture implemented from the start. If CCS is implemented at these plants, 14-28% of baseline CO(2) emissions from fossil fuel power generation in 2030 could be mitigated, equivalent to 220-410 MtCO(2). A key reason indicated by utilities for building a capture-ready plant is (expected) national or EU policies. In addition, financial incentives and expected high CO(2) prices are important.

However, a proposed landscape governance approach to the REDD+ programme, encompassing all land-use activities, could alter these desirable outcomes. Under the proposed approach, governments and private entities could encourage types of land use that have the potential to threaten biodiversity and disrupt ecosystems. Yet a landscape governance approach could also stimulate governments to develop land-use management policies to facilitate adaptation to climate change. I organized focus group discussions with members of conservation groups, REDD+ scholars, and members of the REDD+ agroforestry research community at the Association of American Geographers 2016 Annual Meeting, to identify potential conservation challenges and opportunities associated with carbon-farming in grasslands and plantations under the proposed landscape governance approach to REDD+. I evaluate and synthesize this information, making recommendations for strategies to maximize the conservation opportunities and minimize the challenges.

The combination of carbon dioxide and hydrogen (obtained by means of electrolysis with surpluses of renewable electricity) produces synthetic and renewable fuels that can easily be stored and transported in existing infrastructures. It is also possible to use CO2-enriched microalgae as a feedstock for biofuel. To the extent these advanced fuels can be substituted for fossil energy, they could be helpful in the context of climate mitigation and energy transition, provided the regulatory framework is geared towards such an ambitious purpose. Our comments address the relevance of legislative activity around such a strategy, mainly what kind of legal provisions are already taking shape at the European Union level. We discuss the ability of European directives to manage CO2-fuels and biofuels made from microalgae with CO2 enrichment.

One of the important documents which provide scientific and technological background for CCS is IPCC's Special Report on Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (SRCCS) published in 2005. In the Plan of Action adopted in the Gleneagles Summit in 2005, the G8 leaders agreed that they would work to accelerate the development and commercialization of carbon capture and storage by: ""... inviting the International Energy Agency to work with the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum to hold a workshop on short-term opportunities for CCS in the fossil fuel sector; including from enhanced oil recovery and CO2 removal from natural gas production..."". At their summit in Japan in July 2008, the G8 leaders reassume the importance of CCS saying that ""We strongly support the launching of 20 large-scale CCS demonstration projects globally by 2010, taking into account various national circumstances, with a view to beginning broad deployment of CCS by 2020"" in the Leaders Declaration.

897794,'Slippery slope' or 'uphill struggle'? Broadening out expert scenarios of climate engineering research and development,"It is increasingly recognised that meeting the obligations set out in the Paris Agreement on climate change will not be physically possible without deploying large-scale techniques for either removing greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere or reflecting sunlight away from the Earth. In this article we report on the findings of a scenarios method designed to interrogate how far these 'climate engineering' ideas may develop in the future and under what governance arrangements. Unlike previous studies in climate engineering foresight that have narrowly focussed on academic perspectives, a single climate engineering idea and a restricted range of issues, our approach sought to respond to theoretical imperatives for 'broadening out' and 'opening up' research methods applied to highly uncertain and ambiguous topics. We convened a one-day event with experts in climate change and climate engineering from across the sectors of government, industry, civil society and academia in the UK, with additional experts from Brazil, Germany and India. The participants were invited to develop scenarios for four climate engineering ideas: bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, direct air capture and storage, stratospheric aerosol injection and marine cloud brightening. Manifold challenges for future research were identified, placing the scenarios in sharp contrast with early portrayals of climate engineering research as threatening a 'slippery slope' of possible entrenchments, lock-ins and path dependencies that would inexorably lead to deployment. We suggest that the governance challenges for climate engineering should therefore today be thought of as less of a slippery slope than an 'uphill struggle' and that there is an increasingly apparent need for governance that responsibly incentivises, rather than constrains, research. We find that affecting market processes by introducing an effective global carbon price and direct government expenditure on research and development are incentives with broad potential applications to climate engineering. Responsibly incentivising research will involve a pluralistic architecture of governance arrangements and policy instruments that attends to collective ambitions as well as national differences and emerges from an inclusive and reflexive process.",Climate engineering; Governance; Policy instruments; Research incentives; Scenarios; Slippery slope,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8490878939628601,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
372662,Climate engineering: The way forward?,"The deliberate large-scale manipulation of the climate is increasingly being discussed as a potential tool to ensure the basic condition for a sustainable future: a habitable climate. While far from the ideal solution, the rate of climate change continues to outpace our attempts at a response, prompting some scientists and politicians to call for the consideration of climate engineering or geoengineering to avoid catastrophic climate change, while political processes to reduce greenhouse gases catch up. A November 2010 expert meeting was held at UNESCO to raise awareness of geoengineering, its potential to counteract climate change and its risks, and to broaden the discussion within the international community. Potential geoengineering methods include solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal techniques that are largely theoretical and remain untested, despite a long history. Responsible research can only proceed, and informed decisions be made, once governance structures have been developed beyond mere principles insufficient to guide researchers and policy makers. At the same time, realistic communication on these activities must increase and improve so that civil society can play a role in determining acceptable levels and types of human intervention. Appropriate geoengineering research should be considered for solar geoengineering methods that promise to quickly and affordably decrease global mean temperature, and for carbon geoengineering methods that target the core problem of climate change by directly removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. A small cadre of scientists and policy makers has advanced the discussion of geoengineering and its likely impacts, but the path to a sustainable future cannot be charted until the wider international community asks some fundamental questions about what kind of regulation is appropriate, how it should be implemented and by whom and at what cost. This task is urgent, and only by raising awareness of geoengineering can we secure the participation of the international community in developing governance structures and ensuring that responsible research on geoengineering proceeds in a timely and consensual manner. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",,JOUR,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8489993810653687,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
403238,Harnessing carbon markets for tropical forest conservation: towards a more realistic assessment,"The proposed Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the Kyoto Protocol paves the way for financial and technological transfers to support forestry projects that sequester carbon or protect carbon stocks. From its inception, the concept has been highly controversial. It has been enthusiastically supported by those who believe that conservation of tropical forests will be difficult unless forest owners and managers are compensated for the environmental services of their forests. Others believe that financial transfers supporting 'carbon farming' would ignore social concerns and the full range of goods and services of forests. This paper examines the implications of CDM for forest conservation and sustainable use, by drawing on recent literature and the results of a policy dialogue with CDM stakeholders. We conclude that initial estimates of the contribution tropical forestry could make to both climate change mitigation and to forest conservation need to be scaled down. CDM payments for tropical forestry are likely to be received in a far more limited area than initially expected. The cost-effectiveness of forestry projects relative to projects in the energy sector may have been overestimated. In particular few estimates have adequately accounted for the likelihood that the duration of CDM forestry projects is unlikely to be as long as the residency time of carbon in the atmosphere. Also political realities and investor priorities may not have been sufficiently understood. CDM funding for forestry may also decline in future as economically viable clean technologies are increasingly developed in the energy sector. Tropical forests are likely to be an intermediate climate change mitigation strategy for buying time, until more permanent options become available. The most important justification for including forests in CDM may lie in the contribution CDM could potentially make to forest conservation and sustainable use. An analysis of the implications of CDM for forests reveals the importance of involving forest stakeholders more closely in the CDM debate. To prevent perverse outcomes and reduce the risk of 'leakage' of emission reduction to areas outside project boundaries; CDM projects may need to be limited to niches which meet certain political and institutional preconditions and where sufficient understanding of local decision-making and the broader context is available. CDM may be more effective if used to remove non-economic impediments to forestry activities that are economically viable and meet local needs. Lessons from the forestry sector in relation to plantations, natural forest management, forest conservation and non-timber forest products are discussed to illustrate the dangers of misusing CDM and also to give examples of how CDM could be harnessed for better use of forests. CDM should be seen as one more tool for enhancing the effectiveness of more conventional ways of promoting forest conservation and sustainable use.",Kyoto Protocol; Clean Development Mechanism; tropical forests,Article,2000.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8489754796028137,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
17463,Risk governance for geological storane of CO2 under the Clean Development Mechanism,"Managing local and global risks from the geological storage of CO2 under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) presents three main challenges. First, the CDM procedures must be adapted to the specifics of the technology. Second, storage must last far longer than the crediting period, leaving questions about the management of long-term risks. Third, management of local environmental, health and safety risks falls largely outside the CDM governance framework. CDM procedures could be adapted to successfully manage the short-term global risk of carbon dioxide re-entering the atmosphere during the CDM crediting period, but local environmental, health and safety risks and long-term global risk cannot be ensured under existing structures. To better manage these risks, the implications for the CDM are: (1) to provide guidance on site characterization requirements, and have an independent auditor verify that the proposed geological storage site has a high likelihood of safely containing the injected carbon dioxide; (2) to require that carbon capture and storage (CCS) project design documents specify post-crediting-period commitments; and (3) to support CCS specific capacity building. But because CDM governance is designed to strike a balance between respecting host country sovereignty and ensuring high-quality emission reduction credits, some limitations to risk management of geological storage under the CDM remain. These limitations should be weighed against the potential benefits of including CCS in the CDM.",capacity building; carbon capture and storage (CCS); Clean Development Mechanism (CDM); geological storage; risk governance; seepage; site characterization; technology transfer; time,Article,2009.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8488040566444397,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
371793,Australia: Approaching an energy crossroads,"This paper considers energy policy in Australia in the context of its considerable energy resources, climate change and a recent change in government. It examines the possible paths that future energy use and policy in Australia could take, including published projections based largely on a ""business as usual"" approach and projections based on a dramatic shift towards more efficient use of energy and renewable energy technologies. It also considers the various factors affecting future policy direction, including energy security, the advocacy in Australia for establishing nuclear electricity generation and other parts of the nuclear fuel-cycle, responses to climate change, and carbon sequestration. It concludes that while the Australian Government is currently reluctant to move away from a dependence on coal, and unlikely to adopt nuclear energy generation, a low-emissions future without waiting for the deployment of carbon capture and storage and without resorting to nuclear power is within reach. However, in the face of strong pressure from interest groups associated with energy intensive industry, making the necessary innovations will require further growth of community concern about climate change, and the development of greater understanding of the feasibility of employing low carbon-emissions options.

Our results enable decision makers to assess the following milestones: (1) a minimum of 33% reduction of CO2 emissions by 2055 in order to stay below 550 ppm by 2100 (this milestone goes up to 46% in the case of delayed policies); and (2) carbon neutrality and the effective implementation of innovative geoengineering technologies (10% negative emissions) before 2060 in order to return to 350 ppm in 2100, under the assumption of getting out of the baseline scenario without delay.

It is argued that the creation of learning arenas is critical for the development of immature technologies. The paper then analyses two large efforts to secure state funding of largescale demonstration projects for offshore wind and carbon capture and storage technology in Norway. The paper describes a range of similarities between these two technologies in terms of scale, maturity, and costs, and in the way they represent possible solutions to the problem of climate change. However, the paper also describes enormous differences in government support towards full-scale demonstration. These differences are then explained in the analysis, which shows how different network structures facilitate different levels of access to the policy making process. The paper provides insights into how the interplay between state interests, political party strategies and the interests of firms influences the potency for solutions tied to climate and energy problems. The paper therefore contributes to the discourse on the role of politics in sustainability transitions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Various aspects of possible regulatory frameworks for its implementation are beginning to be discussed in Europe. One of the issues associated with the wide use of CCS is that it requires the establishment of a carbon dioxide (CO2) transport network, which could result in the spatial restructuring of power generation and transmission systems. This poses a significant coordination problem necessitating public planning and regulation.

5292442,"Analysis of challenges, costs, and governance alternative for peatland restoration in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia","Restoration of degraded tropical peatland is considered to be one of the most cost-efficient measures in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and conserving biodiversity. Although benefits of restoration are often expected to substantially exceed the costs, most restoration projects are being carried out without clear cost analyses. This study provides empirical assessments of challenges and costs of the four peatland restoration projects managed by different proponents in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia based on key informant interviews, a follow-up survey and document analyses. We also reviewed existing policy contexts that can address some of the challenges to propose a governance alternative to sustain peatland restoration efforts. We found that many ecological challenges of peatland restoration projects were created by drainage canals leaving the peat to be dry and fire prone. Peatland degradation has been exacerbated by human activities and human-caused fires, and restoration efforts have faced many challenges due to lack of secure funding and complexity of governing the project implementation. The key informants we interviewed easily recognized direct costs for implementing restoration activities, but often left out indirect costs of addressing social challenges, such as expenses to engage local communities, in their assessments of the costs. Although our accounting is far from exhaustive, we found that indirect costs can add up to half of the total cost of peatland restoration projects. Current funding mechanisms for these projects mostly rely on international donors and private sectors, which make the long-term sustainability of the projects questionable. We argue that hybrid governance for a green business model, such as restoration and ecosystem services enterprises, with active participation from the public sector should be mainstreamed.

Nearly all pathways that hold global warming well below 2 degrees C involve carbon removal (IPCC, 2015). In addition, solar geoengineering is being considered as a potential tool to offset warming, especially to limit temperature until negative emissions technologies are sufficiently matured (MacMartin et al., 2018). Despite this, there has been a reluctance to embrace carbon removal and solar geoengineering, partly due to the perception that these technologies represent what is widely termed a ""moral hazard"": that geoengineering will prevent people from developing the will to change their personal consumption and push for changes in infrastructure (Robock et al., 2010), erode political will for emissions cuts (Keith, 2007), or otherwise stimulate increased carbon emissions at the social-system level of analysis (Bunzl, 2008). These debates over carbon removal and geoengineering echo earlier ones over climate adaptation. We argue that debates over ""moral hazard"" in many areas of climate policy are un-helpful and misleading.

Without greenhouse gas removal, the window of opportunity to transition from fossil to zero emission fuels will close by 2020 or 2032 to hold temperature increase to 1.8°C and 2°C respectively; 1.5°C is already unachievable. If greenhouse gas removal is to be relied on to attenuate the transition to close-to-zero greenhouse gas emissions, its deployment should begin in earnest within the next decade if its peak is to be kept below 5Gt(C)year-1 (~18Gt(CO2)year-1).

Under the proposed approach, governments and private entities could encourage types of land use that have the potential to threaten biodiversity and disrupt ecosystems. Yet a landscape governance approach could also stimulate governments to develop land-use management policies to facilitate adaptation to climate change. I organized focus group discussions with members of conservation groups, REDD+ scholars, and members of the REDD+ agroforestry research community at the Association of American Geographers 2016 Annual Meeting, to identify potential conservation challenges and opportunities associated with carbon-farming in grasslands and plantations under the proposed landscape governance approach to REDD+. I evaluate and synthesize this information, making recommendations for strategies to maximize the conservation opportunities and minimize the challenges. Understanding the challenges and opportunities will enable policy makers and other stakeholders to improve the presentation of their arguments in their efforts to shape the course of the REDD+ programme in the post-Paris Agreement era.",Biodiversity conservation; carbon-farming; forest governance; grasslands; landscape governance approach; plantations; REDD,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8460561633110046,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

To examine which public policies and financing strategies could stimulate the mitigation of GHG emissions through CCS and to reflect on the use of that technology in Brazil. Methodology: The research approach was qualitative, exploratory and descriptive, based on documental and bibliographical analysis on the subject. Relevance: Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is an emerging technology to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere and thus mitigate climate change. There is a need for government planning to meet Brazil's commitments under the Paris Agreement, context under which the use of CCS could be assessed as a strategy for the country. Results: The results have shown that the viability of CCS projects is often linked to a strong public policy to support the technology; thus, its implementation on a large scale will possibly be dependent on the political will of the government. Contributions. Analysis of possible approaches to CCS funding in Brazil, also examining possible associations between this technology and some Brazilian sectors, such as oil and gas, bioenergy and cement.

In Brazil, although currently CCS is exclusively associated with the oil and gas sector, this technology could be considered for other sectors as a form of compliance of Brazilian NDCs.",Carbon capture and storage; Public policy; Carbon pricing; Green bonds; Climate change,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8457494378089905,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
41835,"A synopsis of land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) under the Kyoto Protocol and Marrakech Accords","The complexities inherent in land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities have led to contentious and prolonged debates about the merits of their inclusion in the 2008-2012 first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol. Yet the inclusion of these activities played a key role in agreement on the general framework of the Kyoto Protocol, and LULUCF will likely continue to play a substantial part in negotiations on national commitments post-2012. The Marrakech Accords dictate which LULUCF activities are to be included under the Kyoto Protocol and provide rules on how they are to be accounted in the first commitment period. However, these rules have limitations and drawbacks that may be avoided in the structure of future commitments beyond 2012. Through adherence to the objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate.

Analysis of a hypothetical scenario of SG deployment,"As climate change risks become more severe, solar geoengineering (SG) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) are being considered more seriously as potential response options. However, these climate interventions do not fit completely into existing international governance structures. To grapple with and innovate proposed governance mechanisms that accommodate the associated technical, social, and environmental challenges, a scenario exercise took place at the 2019 International Geoengineering Summer School. The present paper summarizes and analyzes the experience working with one of the four hypothetical scenarios of geoengineering deployment, that titled ""Private sector to the rescue?"". It describes SG deployment by a centralized non-state actor who also pursues CDR. The exercise revealed that early engagement of a wide range of stakeholders and open sharing of knowledge base are necessary to pursue a constructive international dialogue. First, the scenario directs a particular attention to the power limitations of state actors, suggesting the collaborative governance regime. Second, because governance is not exercised in a vacuum, it is crucial to consider a broader range of transnational challenges that may jeopardize even a thoroughly designed governance structure. Third, the exercise highlights the importance of an integrated view on climate policy response that recognizes interactions, trade-offs, and synergies between mitigation, adaptation, CDR, and SG.",Scenarios; Climate change; Global warming; Geoengineering; Solar geoengineering; Carbon dioxide removal,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8453293442726135,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
5339139,Atmospheric recovery litigation around the world: Gaining natural resource damages against carbon majors to fund a sky cleanup for climate restoration1,"The planet’s climate emergency requires a full transition away from carbon-intensive fossil fuels as rapidly as possible. But, as ambitious as that is, decarbonization alone is not sufficient. The global mean temperature rise of over one degree Centigrade is a result of excess carbon dioxide already flooding the atmosphere, due to roughly 150 years of greenhouse gas emissions. Achieving climate recovery requires large-scale drawdown of legacy carbon - accomplishing, in effect, a Sky Cleanup. Scientists urge “natural climate solutions” (NCS) projects to scrub the atmosphere of this excess carbon and sequester it in soils and vegetation. NCS projects involve reforestation, improved agricultural methods, mangrove restoration, and regenerative grazing, among other techniques. While promising, NCS solutions are expensive, and funds are elusive. This Chapter maps a legal strategy of Atmospheric Recovery Litigation to hold the major fossil fuel corporations (“carbon majors”) liable for funding such atmospheric cleanup. Public trust law traditionally holds polluters liable for natural resource damages to public trust assets, such as marine waters, obligating sovereign trustees to seek recovery of such damages to fund restoration of the public’s damaged ecology. This article applies these established principles to the atmosphere, a public trust asset. While atmospheric recovery on a global scale is unprecedented, the underlying legal principles parallel the approach traditionally applied to discrete resources. The analysis in this Chapter draws upon emerging litigation involving other types of pollution (caused by PCB, MTBE and PFAS chemicals) that shows early success in holding manufacturer corporations responsible for funding public cleanup efforts. © The Editors and Contributors Severally 2021.",,Book Chapter,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8453265428543091,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
722299,The governance of innovations in the energy sector: Between adaptation and exploration,"The field of electricity supply has slowly evolved over a long period of time. Electricity supply constitutes an example of a large technical system resistant to sudden changes or reorientations. The essential incentives for changes have come from the so called oil-price shocks in the mid ninety-seventies of the last century, the Chernobyl accident and the resulting critical attitude towards nuclear energy in many countries, the liberalization of markets driven forward by the European Commission, discussions about climate change and fi nally the Fukushima catastrophe. Such external events can lead to changes in governance structures. The standard operating procedure is to have the incumbent actors deal with external challenges in the established way of doing things (structures and actors). We assume that changes in the governance structure are not an immediate reaction to external shocks, but rather these external shocks have to be interpreted, mediated by new, skilled actors and perceived as a chance to see things diff erently and organize and build coalitions around these new frames. For a successful transformation, a change in the relevant power constellations which supports the incumbent governance structure is required. Processes of change in the end deal with the following question: which actors can achieve what aims under what conditions? The article will analyze four prominent cases in the energy sector to illustrate this point: the governance of the carbon dioxide capture & storage technology in Germany and Norway and the governance of photovoltaics development in Japan and Germany.",,Article,2014.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8452705144882202,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Lack of adequate and consistent support for rt has, however, contributed to the slow pace of deployment to date. Enjoying near-universal membership, the Paris Agreement was adopted in December 2015 as the comer-stone for global cooperation on climate change. To date, 10 nationally determined contributions comprise carbon capture and storage deployment as a mitigation option in the drive to achieve the international community's climate goals.The degree to which the Paris Agreement will succeed in accelerating such deployment remains unclear despite the clear potential of carbon capture and storage to meet the agreement's goals. This study assesses the extent to which the Paris Agreement's key concepts and provisions in this area facilitate the utilisation of carbon capture and storage technology and the way in which the agreement may influence steps taken to develop and deploy this technology. In this context the central concepts of the agreement are 'ambrtion and 'differentiation'.

Nonetheless, in recent years, several projects have been cancelled or postponed. This raises some questions about temporal issues. This study defines temporal features (i.e. frame, timing, tempo, and duration) for policy making and deployment of large-scale CCS projects. According to this study, it appears that CCS deployment is lagging behind due to institutional inertia and poor temporal fit. Thus, unless significant progress is made in a very few years, CCS will lose ground to other alternatives. Timing should be taken into consideration in every matter of CCS. (C) 2017 The Authors.

1945360,Making the Most of Our Land: Managing Soil Functions from Local to Continental Scale,"The challenges of achieving both food security and environmental sustainability have resulted in a confluence of demands on land within the European Union (EU): we expect our land to provide food, fiber and fuel, to purify water, to sequester carbon, and provide a home to biodiversity as well as external nutrients in the form of waste from humans and intensive livestock enterprises. All soils can perform all of these five functions, but some soils are better at supplying selective functions. Functional Land Management is a framework for policy-making aimed at meeting these demands by incentivizing land use and soil management practices that selectively augment specific soil functions, where required. Here, we explore how the demands for contrasting soil functions, as framed by EU policies, may apply to very different spatial scales, from local to continental scales. At the same time, using Ireland as a national case study, we show that the supply of each soil function is largely determined by local soil and land use conditions, with large variations at both local and regional scales. These discrepancies between the scales at which the demands and supply of soil functions are manifested, have implications for soil and land management: while some soil functions must be managed at local (e.g., farm or field) scale, others may be offset between regions with a view to solely meeting national or continental demands. In order to facilitate the optimization of the delivery of soil functions at national level, to meet the demands that are framed at continental scale, we identify and categorize 14 policy and market instruments that are available in the EU. The results from this inventory imply that there may be no need for the introduction of new specific instruments to aid the governance of Functional Land Management. We conclude that there may be more merit in adapting existing governance instruments by facilitating differentiation between soils and landscapes.",Functional Land Management; ecosystem services; policy; soil functions; sustainable intensification,Article,2015.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8441613912582397,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
4168368,With Power Comes Responsibility - A Rangelands Perspective on Forest Landscape Restoration,"Tree planting has long been promoted to avert climate change and has received renewed impetus in recent years with the Bonn Challenge and related forest restoration initiatives guided by the forest and landscape restoration (FLR) framework. Much of the focus for reforestation and afforestation is on developing countries in Africa, Asia and South America, where large areas of rangelands in drylands and grassy biomes are portrayed as ""degraded,"" ""unused,"" and in need of more trees. This perception is rooted in persistent theories on forests and desertification that widely shaped colonial policy and practice and remain influential in today's science-policy frameworks. From a rangelands perspective, the global FLR thrust raises two main concerns. First, inappropriate understandings of the ecology of drylands and grassy biomes encourage afforestation, grazing restriction and fire suppression, with negative impacts on hydrology, carbon storage, biodiversity, livestock production and pastoral livelihoods. Second, their target-driven approach requires large-scale afforestation and massive funding to achieve. Nearly half of the area pledged to the Bonn Challenge is in fact destined for forestry and other commercial plantations, which threaten pastoral livelihoods and cause ecological damage while having very limited potential to mitigate climate change. As the officially endorsed framework of the Bonn Challenge and related global restoration initiatives, FLR has become a powerful instrument for guiding global restoration efforts and funding. Its proponents have a responsibility to ensure that the framework is evidence-based and underpinned by appropriate ecological models for different ecoregions.",savanna; rangeland; pastoralism; grassland; climate change; Bonn Challenge; afforestation; drylands,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8439713716506958,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This paper takes a brief look at international environmental law principles relevant to CCS, identifies key environmental and safety risks associated with the technology, and highlights significant legal frameworks that pose challenges to the implementation of CCS within the EU under EU and international law. It then notes continuing regulatory gaps that will need to be addressed for large-scale CCS to take place. The paper concludes that the clear inclusion or exclusion of CCS activities from the range of relevant legal frameworks will increase transparency, provide regulatory certainty and ultimately facilitate CCS in appropriate contexts.

193264,Incorporating ecosystem services into the implementation of existing US natural resource management regulations: Operationalizing carbon sequestration and storage,"Many agencies and organizations, including in the United States federal government, are expressing interest in the measurement and valuation of ecosystem services. Despite this interest, specific guidance on whether and how to incorporate ecosystem services into federal activities remains scarce. This analysis examines three regulations that are important parts of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's mission to protect coastal and marine habitats: the Clean Water Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, and the Natural Resources Damage Assessment process that is part of the Oil Pollution Act. Case studies of each reveal that it is possible to incorporate the carbon sequestered and stored in coastal habitats, or ""carbon services,"" into existing processes consultative, regulatory, and mitigative that are employed to implement these regulations. Specific examples illustrate how carbon services could be incorporated into the implementation of each federal regulation. The study concludes that incorporating carbon services into the implementation of existing environmental regulations could provide increased protection or restoration of coastal habitats. Increased conservation outcomes could result from changing the way the federal government implements national policy and/or by stimulating increased investment in coastal habitat conservation through private carbon markets. These outcomes would result in a ""win-win"" for both climate regulation and habitat conservation and would preserve not only the carbon services, but also the many ecosystem services these habitats provide.

1844759,Emerging legislative regimes for regulating carbon capture and storage activities in Australia: To what extent do they facilitate access to procedural justice?,"Anthropogenic climate change is a fundamental challenge. Of the various responses to this ""super wicked problem"", carbon capture and storage (CCS) is one that has been mooted in Australia during recent years. While many commentators continue to question the technological and economic feasibility of CCS, a number of Australian governments have adopted a proactive stance to CCS by amending or enacting legislation to regulate CCS activities in their respective jurisdictions. To date, there has been little critical examination of these legislative regimes and their implications for the future role of CCS in Australia. Accordingly, this article focuses upon one central area of CCS regulation that has not been comprehensively addressed by the existing literature - that is, the extent to which emerging legislative regimes for regulating CCS activities in Australia facilitate access to procedural justice. Access to procedural justice will generally be facilitated in circumstances where the law gives procedural rights to members of the community of justice to: have access to information, participate in decision-making processes, and have access to review procedures before a court or tribunal to challenge decision-making or impairment of substantive or procedural rights. This article undertakes a comparative analysis of the laws that have been enacted or amended to regulate CCS activities in Australian jurisdictions in order to identify standards of best practice for facilitating access to procedural justice. It finds that while many of the laws regulating CCS activities in Australia reflect clear attempts by government to facilitate access to procedural justice, some of these laws fall short of facilitating access to procedural justice in an adequate or sufficient manner. Recommendations for law reform are made with the aim of providing guidance as to how Australian CCS laws can better facilitate access to procedural justice in the future.",,Article,2015.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8429456949234009,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
402461,The political economy of reforestation and forest restoration in Asia-Pacific: Critical issues for REDD+,"Under REDD+, the enhancement of carbon stocks through reforestation and restoration of degraded forest landscapes offers considerable potential benefits. In the Asia-Pacific region, however, many previous reforestation and forest restoration initiatives have exacerbated existing inequities by concentrating resources among powerful political and economic actors, often to the detriment of forest-dependent communities. Both in design and implementation, tree-planting programs have been guided by forest rent distribution practices of state forestry bureaucracies and by corporate accumulation strategies linked to increasingly globalized commodity chains.This article examines the political economy of reforestation and forest restoration programs in Asia-Pacific and highlights governance challenges these pose. In various contexts, they have:. •consolidated the control of state agencies and corporate actors over 'degraded' forest landscapes, often resulting in the displacement of rural communities;•exacerbated economic disparities by channeling large capital subsidies and resource rents to companies with close ties to state elites;•facilitated corruption and financial fraud, in some cases on a grand scale;•accelerated biodiversity loss by creating perverse incentives for the conversion of 'degraded' secondary forests; and•generated mixed results for rural small-holders, at times locking them in inequitable agreements with plantation companies, and in other cases, offering enhanced tenure security.To avoid the negative results of earlier reforestation schemes, REDD+ must incorporate: (1) rights-based spatial planning; (2) equitable and accountable distribution of financial incentives; (3) improved financial governance to prevent corruption and fraud; (4) policy reform to remove perverse incentives for forest conversion; (5) strengthening of economic benefits and safeguards for small-holders. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8424176573753357,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Norway's unique geology has understandably prompted a particular interest in the subject. This article analyses the interests and relative influence of the key domestic actors (the oil industry, environmental organizations, political parties and government bureaucracy) who wield influence in policy-making processes concerning carbon dioxide storage. Despite the level of interest aroused by the issue in Norway, the evidence suggests that policy will not move in the direction of an international carbon storage agreement. This is mainly because Norwegian policy-making in the field is dominated by the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy, whose current interests do not seem compatible with such a position. The fact that carbon storage can be developed in accordance with Norway's interests as a petroleum producer may, however, be a decisive factor for the political parties, government bureaucracy and the oil industry in the future.",Norway; climate change; carbon capture and storage (CCS); sequestration; mitigation; public policy,Article,2007.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8421117663383484,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The first claim is that there are moral justifications supporting strategic investment into CO2 storage from global and regional perspectives. One argument draws on the empirical evidence which suggests carbon capture and storage would play a significant role in a portfolio of global solutions to climate change; the other draws on Rawls' notion of legitimate expectations and Moellendorf's Anti-Poverty principle. The second claim is that where to pursue this strategic investment poses a morally non-trivial problem, with considerations like near-term global distributive justice and undermining legitimate expectations favouring investing in developing regions, especially in Asia, and considerations like long-term climate impacts and best uses of resources favouring investing in the relatively wealthy regions that have the best prospects for successful storage development.",Carbon capture and storage; Climate change; Climate justice; Global distributive justice; Legitimate expectations; Paris agreement,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8420541882514954,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

These actions are addressing the climate change issue, the introduction of renewable energy sources, the security of energy supply, the promotion of energy efficiency and the opening of energy markets. The research policy of the Commission is mainly the European Research Area concept and its number one instrument, the Framework Programmes for research and technological development. The rational and the analysis supporting the ERA will be covered, as well as the structure and the new implementation modalities of the Framework Programme. Initial ideas for the 7th framework programme covering the years 2006-2013 will be debated. CO2 capture and sequestration projects are organised to fit into the above-mentioned research policy, while contributing to the successful deployment of the Commission energy policies. These projects represent a portfolio of the order of 140 m€ of research and technological development. Future perspectives, in particular in view of initiatives in the international arena and the Zero Emission Power Technology Platform, are finally outlined, addressing the need for an integrated European approach to develop and demonstrate CO2 capture and storage technologies for the benefit of the European citizens, industry and society.

2461118,The politics and governance of negative emissions technologies,"The starting point of this paper is the Paris Agreement under the UNFCCC agreed in 2015 and its global temperature goal.It highlights that the current pathway of decarbonization would result in a sharp temperature increase by 2100 (see Sect. 1) that would result in unacceptable risks of climate change (see Sect. 2).Those risks cannot be properly addressed by adaptation activities as long as there are no reliable expectations of the climate changes expected over the lifetime of current projects.The paper informs about such recently published projections that suggest that global surface temperatures will increase by approximately 5 °C (9 °F) over pre-industrial temperatures by the year 2100 and discusses options to bridge the gap to the goals specified in the Paris Agreement.In this context also two main geoengineering options carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiative management (SRM) and their associated risks are considered.At the center of the paper two proposals are made on a limited use of geoengineering that should finally help meet the goals of the Paris Agreement without increasing risks of geoengineering unduly, provided that decarbonization is significantly accelerated beyond the plans included in current National Determined Contributions.One conclusion is that geo-engineering can only provide a small contribution to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement and that the main contribution needs to come from enhanced mitigation action.The paper also highlights how recommendations of the Financial Stability Board could contribute to result in the necessary shift of investments to accelerate GHG emission reduction and informs about a recent initiative to establish the necessary governance framework to manage geoengineering. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",Climate action; Climate change risks; Geo-engineering; Paris agreement,Book Chapter,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8414031267166138,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Given the perceived lack of comprehensive and comparative appraisals of different CE methods, the Priority Program was designed to encompass both solar radiation management (SRM) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) ideas and to cover the atmospheric, terrestrial, and oceanic realm. First, key findings obtained by the ongoing Priority Program are summarized and reveal that, compared to earlier assessments such as the 2009 Royal Society report, more detailed investigations tend to indicate less efficiency, lower effectiveness, and often lower safety. Emerging research trends are discussed in the context of the recent Paris agreement to limit global warming to less than two degrees and the associated increasing reliance on negative emission technologies. Our results show then when deployed at scales large enough to have a significant impact on atmospheric CO2, even CDR methods such as afforestation-often perceived as ""benign""-can have substantial side effects and may raise severe ethical, legal, and governance issues.

936278,"Risks, revenues and investment in electricity generation: Why policy needs to look beyond costs","Energy policy goals frequently depend upon investment in particular technologies, or categories of technology. Whilst the British government has often espoused the virtues of technological neutrality. UK policies now seek to promote nuclear power, coal with CO2 capture and storage, and renewable energy. Policy decisions are often informed by estimates of cost per unit of output (for example,  pound/MWh), also known as levelised costs. Estimates of these costs for different technologies are often used to provide a 'ballpark' guide to the levels of financial support needed (if any) to encourage uptake, or direct investment away from the technologies the market might otherwise have chosen. Levelised cost estimates can also help to indicate the cost of meeting public policy objectives, and whether there is a rationale for intervention (for example, based on net welfare gains). In the UK electricity sector, investment is undertaken by private companies, not governments. Investment is driven by expected returns, in the light of a range of risks related to both costs and revenues. Revenue risks are not captured in estimates of cost or cost-related risks. An important category of revenue risk is associated with electricity price fluctuations. Exposure to price risks differs by technology. Low electricity prices represent a revenue risk to technologies that cannot influence electricity prices. By contrast, 'price makers' that set marginal prices are, to an extent, able to pass fuel price increases through to consumers. They have an inherent 'hedge' against fuel and electricity price fluctuations. Based on recent research by the UK Energy Research Centre, this paper considers the implications of such price risks for policy design. The authors contrast the range of levelised costs estimated for different generating options with the spread of returns each is exposed to when electricity price fluctuations are factored in. Drawing on recent policy experiences in the renewable energy arena, in the UK and elsewhere, the authors provide an assessment of investment risk in policy effectiveness and consider how policy design can increase or ameliorate price risk. They discuss the circumstances under which policy goals might be best served by 'socialising' price risk, through fixed price policies. The importance of increased and explicit attention to revenue risk in policymaking is discussed, along with the means by which this might be achieved. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This paper sets out to examine CCS policymaking in the EU by analysing the way this technology was framed. It draws up a simple model of technology framing with two variants. The first one describes the creation of ""mainstream frames"" of technologies in policymaking. The second one explains the effects of a ""hegemonic frame"", namely the weakening of evaluation criteria and the increased salience of ""blind spots"". On this basis, this paper explains the global mainstreaming of a CCS frame and its transformation into a hegemonic frame in the EU. Finally, the paper reviews the blind spots in this hegemonic frame and their impact on EU policy. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

1821153,MAKING THE MOST OF OUR LAND: MEETING SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF SOIL FUNCTIONS ACROSS SPATIAL SCALES,"The challenges of achieving both food security and sustainability have resulted in a confluence of demands on land within the European Union: we expect our land to provide food, purify, water, sequester carbon, and provide a home to biodiversity and to external nutrients. All soils perform all these five functions, but some soils are better at' supplying selective functions. Functional Land Management is a framework for policy making aimed at meeting these demands by incentivising soil management and land use practices that selectively augment specific soil functions, where required. In this paper, we explore how the demands for contrasting soil functions, as framed by EU policies, may apply to very different spatial scales, from farm scale to national scale. At the same time, we show that the supply of each soil function is largely defined by local soil and land use conditions, with large variations at both local and regional level. We demonstrate that this has implications for soil management. While some soil functions must be managed at local (i.e. farm) level, others may be offset between regions with a view to solely meeting national targets. We review the policy instruments available to address the challenge of maximising the delivery of soil functions across these spatial scales, and bring these instruments together in a coherent policy framework.",Functional Land Management; sustainable intensification,Proceedings Paper,2015.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8401286602020264,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Greater adoption of carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies will drive demand for CDR. Public procurement of low carbon materials is a powerful and under-utilized tool for accelerating the development and of CCUS through a targeted and well-regulated approach. The policy environment is nascent and presents significant barriers for scaling and guiding emerging technology solutions. The concrete sector has unique attributes that make it ideally suited for large-scale low-carbon public procurement strategies.

742209,Apres Paris: Breakthrough innovation as the primary moral obligation of rich countries,"While the notion of differentiated responsibility has always included an element of technological transfer, the growing disparity between the deployment of non-scalable renewable energy sources in the rich countries and the massive expansion of fossil infrastructure elsewhere has brought new urgency to issues of climate leadership. Breakthrough innovation into technologies capable of providing an abundance of clean energy now appears necessary not only to broaden energy access but also to ensure that fossil fuels are quickly displaced globally (including in those countries that have failed to take climate change seriously). Moreover, it is reasonable to expect that a climatechanged world in itself will demand abundant energy to facilitate everything from carbon dioxide removal to mass desalination for agriculture and other adaptation measures. Considering the moral and political impossibility of treating sustained poverty as the ""solution"" to the climate crisis, this paper suggests that rich countries have a moral obligation to invest in breakthrough innovation into technologies that are compatible with a future global economic convergence around OECD-levels.

3403353,De facto governance: how authoritative assessments construct climate engineering as an object of governance,"Analyses of climate engineering (CE) governance have accelerated in the last decade. A key claim is that CE remains a largely ungoverned space, with shared norms, institutional arrangements, and formal rules to regulate CE not yet present. In contrast, here it is argued that de facto governance of CE is underway, discernible in an ordering of this nascent field of inquiry by unacknowledged sources of steering. One key source of de facto governance is analyzed: high-level 'authoritative assessments' of CE. The focus is on how these assessments are constructing CE as an object of governance through demarcating and categorizing this emerging field of inquiry, and how this contributes to normalizing and institutionalizing CE research (and CE research communities). Scrutinizing the distinct nature and political implications of de facto governance, particularly of novel and speculative technological trajectories not yet subject to formal steering, remains a key task for governance scholars.",De facto governance; climate engineering; geoengineering; scientific assessments; carbon dioxide removal; solar radiation management,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8397613763809204,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
5196874,Integrating Carbon Dioxide Removal Into European Emissions Trading,"In one of the central scenarios for meeting an European Union-wide net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions target by 2050, the emissions cap in the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) becomes net negative. Despite this ambition, no mechanism allows for the inclusion of CO2 removal credits (CRCs) in the EU ETS to date. Amending the EU ETS legislation is required to create enabling conditions for a net negative cap. Here, we conceptually discuss various economic, legal, and political challenges surrounding the integration of CRCs into the EU ETS. To analyze cap-and-trade systems encompassing negative emissions, we introduce the effective (elastic) cap resulting from the integration of CRCs in addition to the regulatory (inelastic) cap, the latter now being binding for the net emissions only. Given current cost estimates for BECCS and DACCS, minimum quantities for the use of removals, as opposed to ceilings as currently discussed, would be required to promote the near-term integration of such technologies. Instead of direct interaction between the companies involved in emissions trading and the providers of CRCs, the regulatory authority could also transitionally act as an intermediary by buying CRCs and supplying them in turn conditional upon observed allowances prices, for example, by supporting a (soft) price collar. Contrary to a price collar without dedicated support from CRCs, in this case (net) compliance with the overall cap is maintained. EU legislation already provides safeguards for physical carbon leakage concerning CCS, making Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) and Direct Air Capture and Storage prioritized for inclusion in the EU ETS. Furthermore, a special opportunity might apply for the inclusion of BECCS installations. Repealing the provision that installations exclusively using biomass are not covered by the ETS Directive, combined with freely allocated allowances to these installations, would allow operators of biomass installations to sell allowances made available through the use of BECCS. Achieving GHG neutrality in the EU by 2050 requires designing suitable incentive systems for CO2 removal, which includes the option to open up EU emissions trading to CRCs.

224911,An International Relations perspective on the global politics of carbon dioxide capture and storage,"With the publication of the IPCC Special Report on Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS), CCS has emerged as a focal issue in international climate diplomacy and energy collaboration. This paper has two goals. The first goal is to map CCS activities in and among various types of intergovernmental organisations; the second goal is to apply International Relations (IR) theories to explain the growing diversity, overlap and fragmentation of international organisations dealing with CCS. Which international organisations embrace CCS, and which refrain from discussing it at all? What role do these institutions play in bringing CCS forward? Why is international collaboration on CCS so fragmented and weak? We utilise realism, liberal institutionalism and constructivism to provide three different interpretations of the complex global landscape of CCS governance in the context of the similarly complicated architecture of global climate policy. A realist account of CCS's fragmented international politics is power driven. International fossil fuel and energy organisations, dominated by major emitter states, take an active role in CCS. An interest-based approach, such as liberal institutionalism, claims that CCS is part of a ""regime complex"" rather than an integrated, hierarchical, comprehensive and international regime. Such a regime complex is exemplified by the plethora of international organisations with a role in CCS. Finally, constructivism moves beyond material and interest-based interpretations of the evolution of the institutionally fragmented architecture of global CCS governance. The 2005 IPCC Special Report on CCS demonstrates the pivotal role that ideas, norms and scientific knowledge have played in transforming the preferences of the international climate-change policy community.

Nevertheless, geoengineering options are receiving attention on the basis that additional approaches may also be necessary. Here we review the state of knowledge on large-scale ocean fertilization by adding iron or other nutrients, either from external sources or via enhanced ocean mixing. On the basis of small-scale field experiments carried out to date and associated modelling, the maximum benefits of ocean fertilization as a negative emissions technique are likely to be modest in relation to anthropogenic climate forcing. Furthermore, it would be extremely challenging to quantify with acceptable accuracy the carbon removed from circulation on a long term basis, and to adequately monitor unintended impacts over large space and time-scales. These and other technical issues are particularly problematic for the region with greatest theoretical potential for the application of ocean fertilization, the Southern Ocean.

5336639,Governing Carbon Dioxide Removal in the UK: Lessons Learned and Challenges Ahead,"This Policy Brief reviews the experience of the UK in developing principles for the governance of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) at scale. Early discussions on CDR governance took place in two separate and somewhat disjointed policy domains: forestry, on the one hand, and R&D support for novel “geoengineering” technologies, on the other. The adoption by the UK government of a 2050 “net zero” target is forcing an integration of these disparate perspectives, and should lead to a more explicit articulation of the role CDR is expected to play in UK climate strategy. This need for clarification is revealing some of underlying tensions and divisions in public views on CDR, particularly when it comes to forms of capture and sequestration deemed to be “non-natural.” We propose some principles to ensure that the development and deployment of carbon dioxide removal at scale strengthens a commitment to ambitious climate change mitigation and can thus enjoy broad public support.

721831,How policy choice affects investment in low-carbon technology: The case of CO2 capture in indirect coal liquefaction in China,"An improved understanding of investment decisions on low-carbon technology will greatly facilitate assessing the effectiveness of carbon emissions mitigation policies. We use the example of implementing CCS (carbon capture and storage) within ICL (indirect coal liquefaction), a controversial technology in China, by constructing a RO (real options) model for the investment decision-making process to assess how different climate policies affect low-carbon technology investors under highly uncertain circumstances. We find that a carbon tax provides the strongest signal for investment and that a market-based measure provides firms with flexibility. Moreover, different types of carbon markets generate substantially different effects on firm behavior, and the CO2 price level exerts a more powerful influence on investors than market volatility or the policy's implementation date. Considering the regional disparities among the coal-abundant but less-developed provinces and the affluent coastal regions in China, we suggest that a sub-national CDM (clean development mechanism) would complete the current domestic policy framework to balance the development requirement and CO2 abatement, whereas extraordinary administrative efforts are necessary to raise the current price of CO2 credits to an effective level, to broaden the carbon market coverage and consolidate the carbon market foundation.

This study attempts to explore a non-fiscal incentive policy, granting a time extension (extra electricity quota), to finance early CCS demonstration projects in China. We find that coal-fired power plant (CFPP) operate at a loss even without CCS retrofitting under the current electricity quota (4000 h per year), while it can make profits with CCS retrofitting if extra electricity quotas are provided. Specifically, the electricity quota needs to be roughly 4709-7260 h per year with the CO2 capture level ranging from 0.1 to 1 Mt per year in the demonstration stage. In particular, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) of CFPP with a capture level of 1 Mt per year is estimated at 298.8 CNY/MWh if the electricity quota reaches 7000 h per year, which is approximately equal to that of CFPP without CCS retrofitting and extra electricity quota (292.2 CNY/MWh). Thus, the extra electricity quota can be considered as an economically feasible policy incentive, and related results are able to provide useful information for electric power enterprises and government decisionmakers.",CCS; Financing; Policy incentive; Electricity quota; LCOE,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.8378506898880005,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

This can create a reliance on private-sector funding via corporate social responsibility (CSR), which centres decision-making power with firms regarding how, where, and when mangrove rehabilitation is implemented. Loosely-defined national targets lead stakeholders to report 'false successes' based on the spatial area planted, rather than on the long-term survival rate of afforested or reforested mangroves. This creates a 'cycle of failure' with little institutional learning (i.e., feedbacks on the ecological reasons for failure), and duplicated rehabilitation efforts. The strong institution of corporate philanthropy in Thailand makes subsequent CSR money readily available, while coinciding restoration events with public holidays associated with the Thai Royal Family motivates local participants to try again. Contemporary narratives from two progressive mangrove rehabilitation projects - with long-term collaboration, cooperation, and monitoring - help identify re-commendations for overcoming these long-standing institutional challenges. The article demonstrates how weak and unequal actor relations-resulting from capacity limitations, power asymmetries, and cultural ideologies-creates gaps between policy design and implementation, thus leading to ineffective environmental governance.",Co-management; Conservation; Ecological restoration; Environmental management; Environmental policy; Neoliberalism; Public-private partnerships; Wetland,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8372927308082581,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
484707,Policy incentives for carbon capture and storage technologies in Europe: A qualitative multi-criteria analysis,"In this paper, we compare different policy incentives for overcoming investment uncertainties that are typical for low-carbon technologies prior to their commercialisation, some of which may be attributable to market failures. The paper focuses on the particular case of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies and conducts a qualitative multi-criteria analysis of different public policy support schemes for CCS demonstration to evaluate their suitability. The assessed schemes include mandatory CCS, emission performance standards and several different financial incentives (in addition to the European Union Emission Trading Scheme). Based on the available literature and on experience in the UK and Germany with promotion instruments for low-carbon technologies, the results of our analysis suggest that two alternative schemes, a CCS bonus incentive or a carbon dioxide (CO2) price guarantee, perform best in comparison with the other assessed instruments. While they reduce the uncertainty of CCS investments in the face of low European Union Allowance prices, they also avoid significant adverse impacts on operational and investment decisions in electricity markets.

Therefore, it is important to implement Government Regulation of 2016 about the Protection and Management of Peat Ecosystems to meet the basic needs of the community from local resources. The problem is what is the government's effort to improve the realization of food sufficiency through the use of peatlands and what is the legal basis above that. The research methods use a normative juridical method, by used secondary data obtained through study literature and analysed qualitatively. The results and discussion of this research are that the government's efforts in applying standard technology efficiently produce useful results with the use of peat as a solution to food security through a touch of technology.

1880191,"Federal research, development, and demonstration priorities for carbon dioxide removal in the United States","Atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies may be critical to achieving deep decarbonization. Yet a lack of technical and commercial maturity of CDR technologies hinders potential deployment. Needs for commercialization span research, development, and demonstration (RD&D) activities, including development of new materials, reactors, and processes, and rigorous monitoring of a portfolio of demonstration projects. As a world leader in supporting science and engineering, the United States (US) can play an important role in reducing costs and clarifying the sustainable scale of CDR. To date, federal agencies have focused on voluntary or piecemeal CDR programs. Here, we present a synthesis of research and developement needs, relevant agency authority, barriers to coordination, and interventions to enhance RD&D across the federal government of the US. On the basis of agency authority and expertise, the Department of Energy, Department of Agriculture, Department of the Interior, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and National Science Foundation are most central to conducting research, funding projects, monitoring effects, and promulgating regulations. Key enablers for successful programs include embracing technological diversity and administrative efficiency, fostering agency buy-in, and achieving commercial deployment. Based on these criteria, the executive branch could effectively coordinate RD&D strategy through two complementary pathways: (1) renewing intra-agency commitment to CDR in five primary agencies, including both research and demonstration, and (2) coordinating research prioritization and outcomes across agencies, led by the Office of Science and Technology Policy and loosely based on the National Nanotechnology Initiative. Both pathways can be stimulated by executive order or Congressional mandate.

All of these coal conversion technologies have very high carbon footprints. The promoters of high-carbon technologies frequently invoke the possibility of carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) to justify high-carbon development. However, apart from two small pilot projects that capture less than 5% of their carbon emissions, none of the other coal-to-chemicals projects incorporate CCS operation.

This paper reflects on an Australian geoengineering scenario project as a practical and innovative platform for informing governance. We produce multi-scale scenarios-representing Australia and the world- built on four fundamentally different archetypes, in which three include geoengineering. According to the four scenarios: greenhouse gas emissions continue increasing to 2050 but not long beyond; except with accelerated technology development and adoption, climate change impacts by 2050 become globally relevant; the risk of unilateral geoengineering deployment without adequate governance is low; and the framing of geoengineering deployment can be characterized as either climate mitigation, adaptation or optimization. Australia's role in geoengineering can be described as passive in the global context, but Australia can benefit from an early transition to a low-carbon economy. A review of the evolution of ideas throughout the exercise reveals a process of shared learning that helps to focus governance discussions around key issues. This study is one step towards increasing the presence and influence of the Asia-Pacific in geoengineering discussions, and highlights the value that a tailored scenario exercise can bring to governance discussions.",Geoengineering; Scenarios; Governance; Policy,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8360021114349365,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

It not only examines landholders' motivation but also the challenges of integrating biodiverse forests into the agricultural landscape. Drawing on the contrast between science and policy stakeholders' views on carbon farming and the practical challenges of achieving adaptive governance, the book discusses the significant gap between theory and practice encountered in this field of study. The book suggests ways of improving the decision-making capacity of government officials and policymakers involved in managing carbon and biodiversity markets, as well as introducing measures to promote adaptive governance by engaging landholders in more effective land conservation. Climate change is a pressing issue on the global political agenda, and this book makes an important contribution to the ongoing debate.

270935,Reforming the EU approach to LULUCF and the climate policy framework,"We focus on recent progress in reforming the role of forests and other land use in the EU climate policy framework. EU inclusion of LULUCF (Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry) in the climate policy framework still lags international developments, remaining at odds even with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) Kyoto framework. Though the EU has made some important changes that eclipse even the UNFCCC framework-in particular regarding the inclusion of cropland and grazing land management in mandatory EU-level carbon accounting practices-in other respects the EU has far to go. As part of a strategy for fulfilling emission reduction commitments within the EU burden-sharing agreement, Member states are not permitted to trade either in domestically nor foreign produced forest-based carbon credits. On the other hand, both the EU and the UNFCCC/Kyoto LULUCF frameworks remain distant from an idealized model that could facilitate increased climate change mitigation and a more efficient and balanced use of forest-based resources. Limiting the incorporation of forests in the climate policy framework has significant consequences for the cost and rapidity of emission reductions. Forest potential thus remains under-mobilized for climate change mitigation. In this context, we draw particular attention to the fact that forest-based carbon sequestration's potential contribution to negative emissions represents an important missed opportunity. In the context of ongoing discussions over the EU and UNFCCC's Post-Kyoto frameworks, we propose an all-encompassing LULUCF carbon accounting model incorporating all previously omitted carbon pools and activities, thus weighing LULUCF removals and emissions on a par with emissions from other sectors (industry, the energy sector, end-users). The successful integration of LULUCF into the EU climate policy and carbon-trading frameworks could dovetail neatly with emerging international climate change mitigation efforts.

1779845,World Bank CCS Program activities in Botswana - Results and lessons learned,"The World Bank Carbon Capture and Storage Trust Fund (CCS TF) was established in 2009 to support CO2 capture and storage (CCS) capacity and knowledge building in developing countries(dagger). CCS TF Phase 1 support for CCS in Botswana included an allocation of USD 1.4 million and had the objective of supporting the Government of Botswana in the following areas: 1. Identifying potential geological reservoirs that can be utilized to store CO2 captured from coal-fired power plants; 2. Evaluating institutional and regulatory arrangements for CCS deployment in the country and recommendations for reinforcing institutional capacity; and 3. Providing training, education and capacity building at all stages throughout implementation, including a Study Tour for key individuals. For all three studies, the WB selected Environmental Resources Management Southern Africa (Pty) Ltd (ERM) as the lead consultant, in association with Wellfield Geosciences (Botswana) and Carbon Counts Company (UK) Ltd. The completed geological assessment found that there may be technical potential for geological storage of CO2 in Botswana's geological formations within the Kalahari Karoo Basin, including three areas of interest - the Passarge Basin, the Lephephe Graben and the Mmashoro Low. There is, however, a general lack of CO2 storage-relevant geological data that needs to be developed, if a more accurate assessment of CO2 storage potential is to be undertaken. The Passarge Basin was seen to be worthiest of additional investigation, which could be done through the re-examination of existing data or through new geological exploration. The Mashoro Low and Lephephe Graben are in close proximity to the centres of current coal-bed methane (CBM) exploration, suggesting that the integration of CBM exploitation and CO2 storage processes could be considered. The regulatory and institutional assessment reviewed how CO2 storage could be implemented under the existing legislation and regulation, and identified the gaps, not covered within the existing framework. The assessment found that existing regulatory acts provide certain coverage for most of key elements of the CO2 storage life-cycle, including: storage site prospecting; storage site development licensing/permitting; regulatory oversight; and, provisions for mid to long-term liability where a holder of the waste management license incurs a 30-year liability period. However, some clarification is needed to ensure this is the case. Also, the establishment dedicated government body, mandated to lead the development of CCS would benefit the ongoing CCS program in Botswana. If the Government of Botswana intends to pursue the development of the institutional and technical capacity for development and deployment of CCS technology in Botswana, the following activities should be considered: Building CCS awareness and strengthening coordination across government and industry; Establishment of a CCS technical implementation plan, including the preparation of a CCS roadmap; and Carrying out additional analysis of existing geological data relating to one or more of the formations identified. Based on the experience gained from the execution of this study, the next phase of CCS development in Botswana, as well as similar activities elsewhere would benefit from: Increased government and stakeholder involvement in all stages of the study; A formally mandated government partner to support the undertaking of the study and to implement and take forward the findings; and External technical input/review from experts with experience in the development and execution of CO2 storage projects. This could take the form of a project specific technical advisory panel or a technical panel we a broader mandate across all the CCS TF's activities.

While the debate on the scientific and technical feasibility of a range of geo-engineering technologies rages on, there is an urgent need for analysis of the complex ethical, social and governance issues related to research, experimentation and eventual deployment of these technologies. Our perception survey of Indian policy makers dealing with climate change has identified a number of governance concerns related to geoengineering technologies. Possible unintended consequences and 'side effects' of these technologies raises concerns of differential impacts in the vulnerable global south. Large-scale deployment of BECCS could have significant impact on food security, water resources and biodiversity.

However, calculating the CO2 budget for 1.5 degrees C, it becomes clear that there is nearly no room left for future emissions. Scenarios suggest that negative emission technologies will play an even more important role for 1.5 degrees C than they already play for 2 degrees C. Especially against this background the feasibility of the target(s) is hotly debated, but this debate does not initiate the next steps that are urgently needed. Already the negotiations have featured the move from targets to implementation which is needed in the coming decade. Most importantly, there is an urgent need to develop and implement instruments that incentivize the rapid decarbonization. Moreover, it needs to be worked out how to link the climate and development agenda and prevent a buildup of coal power causing lock-in effects. Short term entry points into climate policy should now be in the focus instead of the fruitless debate on the feasibility of targets.",,Editorial Material,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8336812257766724,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
280867,"Historical, ecological, and governance aspects of intensive forest biomass harvesting in Denmark","Intensive forest harvesting has increased in Fennoscandia over the last few decades. Similar developments may follow throughout Europe as renewable energy replaces fossil fuels. The international literature suggests that intensive harvesting could increase ecological risks to yield, carbon stores, soil fertility, and biodiversity, but geographically specific knowledge is sparse in many countries, and results do not extend beyond 5–30 years after harvesting. We use Denmark as a case for discussing future directions. Forest history is described, and research on ecological effects and their inclusion in governance is reviewed. Denmark was almost completely deforested by the early 1800s, but centuries of afforestation have resulted in a current forest cover of 14.3%. Research commonly uses stem-only harvesting as a reference against which to compare intensive harvesting impacts, but pristine forests would be a more useful reference for ecological processes and biodiversity. However, pristine forests are almost non-existent in Europe, and non-intervention, self-regulating forests provide an alternative. Governance and positions of non-governmental organizations in Denmark focus more on general forest management impacts and conservation of light-demanding biodiversity associated with historic coppicing and grazing than on intensive harvesting. The energy sector drives the development of new governance to verify forest biomass sustainability, but the national knowledge base for such verification is limited. As part of a larger solution, we suggest establishing a network of non-intervention, self-regulating forests that can serve as a reference for long-term research and monitoring of intensive harvesting impacts. This would support the application of adaptive management strategies, and continuous improvements of best management practice guidelines. WIREs Energy Environ 2016, 5:588–610. doi: 10.1002/wene.206.

739360,Policy invention and entrepreneurship: Bankrolling the burying of carbon in the EU,"This article presents the case of a policy invention where various kinds of entrepreneurship and a window of opportunity played important roles. In 2008 the EU adopted a new Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) policy with an inventive funding instrument at its core: the NER 300 fund, based on revenues from the auctioning of emissions trading allowances. Thus far, the literature on policy entrepreneurs has focused more on success factors that enable particular persons to be especially influential than on the defining characteristics of entrepreneurship. We contribute to the literature on entrepreneurship and windows of opportunity by distinguishing two entrepreneurial techniques framing and procedural engineering - and two categories of commitment - 'tortoise' and carpe diem. We conclude that 'tortoises' who contributed to creating the broad and general climate policy window paved the way for issue-specific carpe diemers who promoted the more specific NER 300 policy invention. Furthermore, we distinguish and discuss four different entrepreneurship mechanisms that may influence policy invention processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

This is signifcant because it gives the executive branch the authority to impose carbon regulations on carbon-emitting entities. United States GHG emissions have increased by approximately 17 percent between 1990 and 2007, and the EPA now has the authority to design regulation to reverse this trend. One of the regulatory tools being considered is a cap and trade system, whereby a ceiling is set for allowable carbon dioxide emissions and emitters are allowed to purchase offsets if they exceed their allowable emissions. Forests are major carbon sinks, and reforestation or projects to avoid deforestation are considered an offset with a monetary value under a majority of cap and trade systems.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) allows decarbonisation for sectors that are otherwise technically difficult and expensive to transition. This analysis used a levelised cost of electricity (LCOE) approach to identify optimal market-based mechanisms that would provide necessary funding support for CCS deployment. The results of that analysis were presented to energy policy stakeholders to determine their amenability. Four mechanisms were investigated; capital subsidies, regulated requirements for increased grid services from all generators, a partial capacity and inertia market with emission constraints and a clean energy certificate scheme. As a means for encouraging CCS, subsidies were favoured by stakeholders. The financial analysis suggested this policy could assist CCS, although was not the optimal choice due to its potential market distortion. A carbon-constrained capacity and inertia market was the preferred pathway for the deployment of CCS technologies from an investment viewpoint. This market model encourages a range of other low-emission technologies, including large-scale batteries and pumped-hydro energy storage.

Attempts at aligning adaptation and carbon removalmay genuinely increase adaptive capacity or introduce new vulnerabilities, depending on policy and project design. Based upon four case studies of addressing adaptation needs with adaptive carbon removal, we find that effective implementation is likely to hinge upon predictable climate policy, innovative technical policies such as rigorous life-cycle assessment, and project design with local ecological conditions in mind.

While the European Union CCS Directive establishes a framework for CCS, it does not address specifically the issue of transboundary transportation.

Prior to 2007, firms lobbied governments to treat the oceans as a carbon sink and to allow corporations that dumped iron to sell carbon credits on the international market. However, after 2007 a transnational coalition of oceanographers and advocates opposed this agenda by linking it to an emergent antigeoengineering discourse. Crucial to their efforts was their interpretation of uncertainty: for opponents, scientific uncertainty implied possibly devastating consequences of iron dumping, which was thus best addressed with extreme caution. This normative approach ultimately shaped governance, since advocates successfully used it to lobby institutions in ocean governance to prevent carbon credits from being issued for ocean fertilization. Since these subjective understandings of certainty influenced global ocean governance, this article explains international behavior as a consequence of changing norms.",,Article,2017.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.8323973417282104,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
5284497,Atmospheric CO2 as a resource for renewable energy production: A European energy law appraisal of direct air capture fuels,"The high concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere is considered the root cause of climate change. However, in the future atmospheric CO2 could play a strategic role towards a renewable energy transition due to its use as a carbon source for the production of goods. Notably, direct air capture (DAC) technology, by removing CO2 from the atmosphere, could support and improve the carbon footprint of the transport and building sector, both of which are responsible for a large part of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Once the CO2 is removed, it can be used to produce synthetic fuels for the transport sector, where there are few low-carbon alternatives, such as aviation and shipping. In this article, we examine European Union legislation, focusing on the Renewable Energy Directive, and conclude that DAC fuels can be considered as renewable energy for the transport sector. Moreover, we highlight that the Directive does not yet regulate the methodology that defines the renewable character of DAC fuels and examine relevant criteria to be considered. In addition, because DAC can possibly be operated in buildings, we examine whether the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is a legal instrument to be considered for deploying this technology.",,Article,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8320937156677246,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
686805,ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FEASIBILITY OF INTERNATIONAL CARBON OFFSETS,"Forests are important in the global carbon cycle, forming a major sink for carbon. Deforestation is a significant source of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere. There is some scope to enhance natural carbon sinks, and therefore reduce net emissions of greenhouse gases, through afforestation and conservation of existing forests. Such initiatives may be implemented to ''offset'' emissions of greenhouse gases from other sources. This may be undertaken by private companies, or by governments as part of bilateral agreements or multilateral arrangements. International carbon offsets may be cost effective in terms of reduction of carbon emissions achieved, and may also be one way to mobilise private capital to fund forest conservation. It is argued here that theoretically the international offset of emissions may lead to a resource saving, and that forest conservation, as opposed to afforestation, may bring about many other benefits. However, such international contracts are unlikely to be feasible or make a major contribution to the control of greenhouse gases. The reasons for this are monitoring, enforcement and scientific uncertainties, and the implicit change in property rights involved in ''selling'' carbon sequestration rights.",CLIMATE CHANGE CONVENTION; ENHANCED GREENHOUSE EFFECT; CARBON STORAGE; FOREST CONSERVATION; ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT,Article,1994.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8320078253746033,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5298502,Integrated Urban Coastal Management in Singapore,"Singapore is a small island city-state without a hinterland, and thus has a coastline that is inseparable from its urban surroundings. As one of the world's busiest ports with a limited marine territory of approximately 600 km(2), issues pertaining to Singapore's coastal environment are closely tied to urban development. As a result of this unique context, Singapore has adapted the Partnerships in the Environmental Management for the Seas of East Asia's (PEMSEA's) Integrated Coastal Management framework for application in a highly urbanized city- state. Known as Integrated Urban Coastal Management (IUCM), this framework and process facilitates Singapore's coastal management through enhancing the coordination of governmental stakeholders and coherence in governance, policies and processes. This paper describes the IUCM experience in Singapore thus far. It includes the principles and objectives of IUCM as well as outline the various instruments, such as Institutional Arrangements, through which Singapore manages its coast. It will also highlight recent and ongoing initiatives - a Comprehensive Marine Biodiversity Survey (CMBS) that includes civil society participation and the application of soft and hard engineering solutions in mangrove restoration for the purposes of coastal protection.

4783640,REGULATION OF THE GEOLOGICAL STORAGE OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN BRAZIL,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology has been receiving a lot of attention since the 1990s because it has been chosen as an option for mitigating climate change. The legal and regulatory frameworks necessary for the broad development of this technology are considered incipient in most countries, as in Brazil. This study showed that Brazil doesn't have specific laws for the regulation of CCS. It can be concluded that Brazil can build on existing regulation in the mining and oil industry to develop a specific regulation on CCS. It was possible to observe, based on the existing regulations in the U.K., the E.U., Denmark, Australia, the USA, and Canada, that for regulation to be effective, consideration of factors such as clarity and efficiency of the administrative process of applying for and obtaining approval for CCS projects and long-term liability for closure, monitoring, and accidental releases of CO2 is essential.",Climate change; CCS; Regulation; oil and mining industry,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8313295245170593,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
8547,Implication of voluntary carbon markets for introducing CSR in the forestry sector of Kazakhstan,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to look at opportunities for Kazakhstan to participate in voluntary carbon markets by submitting forest protection, afforestation and reforestation projects that can be offered to domestic or foreign participants willing to take corporate social responsibility (CSR) and reduce their anthropogenic impact on the climate system by buying these projects. Design/methodology/approach: The study applies a qualitative approach which is based on analysis of scientific articles, entity reports, and national legislative framework related to the topic of the research. Findings: The findings reveal that the issues of CSR, participation in voluntary carbon markets and domestic forestry sector may be integrated if addressed properly. However, Kazakhstan lacks the level of understanding and acceptance of social or environmental responsibilities necessary to engage in CSR practices. In addition, participation of project developers from Kazakhstan in voluntary carbon markets is a subject to the complicated project submission process. Although voluntary carbon markets are not driven by specific regulations and do not require national legal frameworks to enter the voluntary market system, participation may still be a subject to other national legal aspects. Practical implications: The study shows how CSR actions may bring win-win situations both for entities' sustainability reporting which undertake these actions, and for the forestry sector of Kazakhstan. Therefore, a specific strategy should be customized to reflect national circumstances, and which provides assistance for and enhance discussions about CSR, voluntary carbon markets, and their overall contribution to sustainable development. Originality/value: The paper addresses the aspects of taking CSR in a developing country as Kazakhstan where the concept of CSR still lacks supportive legal and promotional mechanisms. It introduces the possible relation of the voluntary carbon markets to the forestry sector of Kazakhstan. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,JOUR,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8312598466873169,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
101966,Stabilizing the agricultural frontier: Leveraging REDD with biofuels for sustainable development,"We evaluate the potential of a proposed policy model that would explicitly link the cultivation of biofuels with forest conservation (Biofuel + FC) as part of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The model postulates that a ratio of 4:1 forest conservation to biofuel cultivation be linked to proposals for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD + Biofuel), while a ratio of 9:1 biofuel cultivation to reforestation on degraded landscape (RDL + Biofuel) be linked to the afforestation/reforestation component of the Clean Development Mechanism. Both biofuel production options would be limited to the cultivation of woody perennial biofuel species on low biomass landscapes in order to maximize the carbon benefits of the proposed policy model. The potential to conserve forest, avoid GHG emissions, improve carbon sequestration, and produce renewable energy are evaluated by an illustrative model for five case studies (Para - Brazil, East Kalimantan - Indonesia, Madagascar, Colombia and Liberia). The Biofuel + FC policy model is then compared with three counterfactual scenarios: REDO Alone with no biofuel cultivation; Biofuel Alone with expanded biofuel cultivation in the absence of REDD and a Most Likely scenario where REDD and biofuel cultivation are implemented without explicit regulatory linkages. The proposed policy model would leverage forest carbon with biofuel markets, which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and conserve biodiversity, as well as improve human welfare in developing countries, a win-win-win strategy for sustainable development.

5259994,Revisiting Green Neoliberalism in India through the Lens of Market-Based Restoration and Reforestation Projects,"This introduction to the special issue revisits the idea of 'green neoliberalism' through the lens of market-based restoration and reforestation projects in India. Addressing the strategic role of forests as 'carbon sinks' and 'service providers' in today's neoliberal reform projects, it contributes to a renewed attention to the material production of such (un)desired natures and their variegated realities. It argues that empirical accounts of how the reorganisation of forests is imagined, how it is implemented through specific programmes, and how it gets entangled into the multi-layered histories of people and places, are critical to understand the tensions but also the openings that neoliberal restructuring at the forested frontier entails. First, the article builds on sustained critiques of 'green neoliberalism' to retrace changes in global environmental politics over the last 30 years, stamped by the extended reach of the market both outward -through a performative discursive shift and quantification drives- and inward, as it now aims at subjecting practices, habits and emotions to relentless rounds of improving and enhancing. Second, it considers these developments against the background of India's forest governance since the 1990s, which saw the emergence of the judiciary as a key institution to enforce environmental laws and countertrends to democratizing forest governance. In light of empirical data collected in the special issue, it asks to what degree instruments such as compensatory afforestation or carbon forestry constitute a departure from older forestry projects, and, in fine, the heuristics of neoliberalism as a category, taking issue with the all-powerfulness of India's State Forest Departments, the long-standing exclusion of local communities, the use of forests as capital for elite bureaucracies, but also the currency and power of the developmental state in India.",Green neoliberalism; forest governance; environmentality; market; developmental state,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8304437398910522,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
732130,Geologic Sequestration of CO2: How EPA's Proposal Falls Short,"Carbon capture and geologic storage has been touted as the critical bridging technology to reduce anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide. The scale of a carbon capture and storage (CCS) program, in terms of land area and storage time, necessary to achieve significant emissions reductions demands a unique statutory and regulatory paradigm to ensure a safe and timely transition from fossil fuels. Deterrents to sequestration are primarily an uncertain legal framework and unconstrained operator liability, as well as environmental concerns. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is proposing to regulate CCS under a modified rule of the Safe Drinking Water Act's Underground Injection Control program. This approach falls short of the comprehensive scheme necessary. It fails to address long-term environmental and financial liabilities unique to CCS and fails to take into account how existing laws and regulations may impede CCS development. This article recommends that CCS be exempted from key federal environmental statutes and regulations and that a wholly unique statutory and regulatory framework be developed as part of a broader effort to curb climate change. Such a framework would limit the long-term liability of injectors to encourage development while offering greater protections for the public and environment against loss and impairment during the highest-risk phases of CCS.",,Article,2009.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8300679922103882,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
621287,Strategy for promoting low-carbon technology transfer to developing countries: The case of CCS,"Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is the critical enabling technology that would reduce CO2 emissions significantly while also allowing fossil fuels to meet the world's pressing energy needs. The International Energy Agency analysis shows that although the developed world must lead the CCS effort in the next decade, there is an urgent need to spread CCS to the developing world. Given technologies for reducing GHG emissions originate mainly in developed countries, technology transfer, as an important feature emphasized by both the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol, therefore has a key role to play in bridging a gap between developed and developing countries. The main objective of this paper is to explore potential policies and schemes promoting the transfer of CCS technologies to developing countries. First, it reviews the global CCS status, analyzes the significant gap of CCS in developed and developing countries, and investigates stakeholder perceptions of diffusing CCS to China, which is a major developing country and a significant potential candidate for large-scale CCS deployment; then the authors make an attempt to understand technology transfer including its benefits, barriers, and definition. The UNFCCC explicitly commits the developed (Annex I) countries to provide financial and technical support to developing countries under favorable terms. The authors argue that the ultimate goal of technology transfer should not only be limited to apply CCS in developing countries, but also to enhance their endogenous capabilities, which will enable future innovation and ensure long-term adoption of low-carbon technologies. As a result, the authors propose a four-pronged approach to the transfer of CCS technologies, which involves physical transfer of explicit technologies, a financial mechanism, endogenous capacity building, and a monitoring mechanism. Concrete enhanced actions to promote CCS technology transfer are also proposed. The four-pronged approach and related enhanced actions proposed in this paper are also applicable to other low-carbon technology transfer. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2148314,Legal and Regulatory Developments Associated with Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage: A Global Update,"Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) is widely seen as a critical technology to de-carbonise the power and industrial sectors. As such, many nations have ambitious plans to demonstrate and then promote commercial scale development of CCS. To facilitate early demonstrations and lay the groundwork for widespread use of CCS, governments are rapidly developing new CCS regulations and policies. There have been a number of important regulatory and legal developments in the European Union, United States, Australia, Canada, Norway and several other jurisdictions. This paper and presentation will provide a brief but comprehensive update of these developments and will document and synthesise discussions and activities that were undertaken as part of the IEA's International CCS Regulators' Network. It is hoped that information sharing of this kind can help to facilitate harmonised global approaches to regulating CCS. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

5336669,Carbon Dioxide Removal Policy in the Making: Assessing Developments in 9 OECD Cases,"Since the adoption of the Paris Agreement in 2015, spurred by the 2018 IPCC Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C, net zero emission targets have emerged as a new organizing principle of climate policy. In this context, climate policymakers and stakeholders have been shifting their attention to carbon dioxide removal (CDR) as an inevitable component of net zero targets. The importance of CDR would increase further if countries and other entities set net-negative emissions targets. The scientific literature on CDR governance and policy is still rather scarce, with empirical case studies and comparisons largely missing. Based on an analytical framework that draws on the multi-level perspective of sociotechnical transitions as well as existing work on CDR governance, we gathered and assessed empirical material until early 2021 from 9 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) cases: the European Union and three of its Member States (Ireland, Germany, and Sweden), Norway, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States. Based on a synthesis of differences and commonalities, we propose a tripartite conceptual typology of the varieties of CDR policymaking: (1) incremental modification of existing national policy mixes, (2) early integration of CDR policy that treats emission reductions and removals as fungible, and (3) proactive CDR policy entrepreneurship with support for niche development. Although these types do not necessarily cover all dimensions relevant for CDR policy and are based on a limited set of cases, the conceptual typology might spur future comparative work as well as more fine-grained case-studies on established and emerging CDR policies.

456448,Algal capture of carbon dioxide; biomass generation as a tool for greenhouse gas mitigation with reference to New Zealand energy strategy and policy,"The use of algae to capture carbon dioxide as a method for greenhouse gas mitigation is discussed. A small fraction of the sunlight energy that bathes Earth is captured by photosynthesis and drives most living systems. Life on Earth is carbon-based and the energy is used to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into biological material (biomass), indeed fossil fuels that we consume today are a legacy of mostly algal photosynthesis. Algae can be thought of as marine and freshwater plants that have higher photosynthetic efficiencies than terrestrial plants and are more efficient capturing carbon (Box I). They have other favourable characteristics for this purpose. In the context of New Zealand energy strategy and policy I discuss progress in growing algae and seaweeds with emphasis on their application for exhaust flue carbon recycling for possible generation of useful biomass. I also introduce schemes utilising wild oceanic algae for carbon dioxide sequestration and the merits and possible adverse effects of using this approach. This paper is designed as an approachable review of the science and technology for policy makers and a summary of the New Zealand policy environment for those wishing to deploy biological carbon sequestration.

Focusing on Ocean Iron Fertilization and Stratospheric Aerosol Injections, I develop several short- and long-term scenarios in which actors are conceivably both willing and able to deploy those technologies on a scale sufficient for impacting the climate system.

Assessing the potential of an ethical governance framework for low-carbon energy through the case of carbon dioxide capture and storage,"In this paper we explore the potential of a framework of ethical governance for low-carbon energy. Developing mainly in the field of information and communications technology, ethical governance is concerned with the marginalisation of ethical and moral issues during development and deployment of new technologies. Focusing on early carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) projects, we argue that a focus on technical arguments in the governance of low-carbon energy similarly risks sidelining deeper issues such as fairness, justice, and values. We believe an ethical governance approach does have potential for low-carbon energy technologies like CCS, but also that climate change mitigation technologies pose particular challenges for the implementation of ethical governance.",carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS); deliberative democracy; epistemic justice; ethical governance; public engagement,Article,2015.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8273088932037354,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
867513,Towards a regulatory design for reducing emissions from agriculture: Lessons from Australia's carbon farming initiative,"The land sector is essential to achieve the Paris Agreement's goals. Agriculture and land use contribute between 20 and 25 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement's aim to keep the average global temperature rise between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius implies that drastic emission cuts from agriculture are needed. The sequestration potential of agriculture and land use offers an important mechanism to achieve a transition to net-zero carbon emissions worldwide. So far, however, states have been reluctant to address emissions from, and sequestration by, the agricultural sector. Some states that have or are setting up a domestic emission-trading scheme allow for the generation of offsets in agriculture, but only to a limited extent. Australia is the only country that has a rather broad set of methodologies in place to award credits to farmers for all kinds of carbon-farming projects. This article reviews the experience with the Australian model so far, with the objective of articulating transferable lessons for regulatory design aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. It finds that it is possible to regulate for the reduction of emissions from agriculture and for increased sequestration in agricultural soils and in vegetation on agricultural lands, provided that certain conditions are met. Regulation must focus on individual projects at farms, based on a long-term policy that has a wider focus than just emission reduction. Such projects must comply with climate-smart methodologies that ensure the delivery of real, additional, measurable, and verifiable emission reductions and also foster long-term innovation and create economic, social, and environmental cobenefits. Moreover, a robust and reliable mrv system must be put in place. © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2017.",,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8272533416748047,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
406670,"Geoengineering: Rights, risks and ethics","This article discusses arguments that manipulating the Earth’s climate may provoke unforeseen, unintended and uncontrollable consequences that threaten human rights. The risks arise from both main types of geoengineering: solar radiation management (SRM) techniques and carbon dioxide removal (CDR). SRM creates particular risks because it is difficult to test on a wide scale and may not be capable of being recalled after deployment. Adequate, enforceable governance structures do not currently exist to assess and regulate the risks of climate engineering, not least whether such technologies can be terminated in the absence of significant emissions reductions. This article is divided into six sections. After the opening introductory section, section 2 discusses the links between climate change and human rights. It briefly outlines the range of rights, including procedural rights, that might be violated by geoengineering. This is followed, in section 3, by an evaluation of the risks of SRM and CDR. The fourth section discusses debates on the ethics of geoengineering. Section 5 critiques hubristic faith in technological solutions. The final section examines the governance of geoengineering and the extent to which international environmental law and human rights law might be used to regulate the research and deployment of geoengineering. © 2017 The Author. and 2017 Edward Elgar Publishing Ltd.",,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8271179795265198,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

551562,"Twists and turns in the jungle: Exploring the evolution of land use, land-use change and forestry decisions within the Kyoto Protocol","The process of including land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF)1 within the Kyoto Protocol (the Protocol) could be viewed as one of the less inspiring examples of the development of international environmental law. It was typified by confusion, manipulated science, obfuscation and poor decision making. The process was like walking through a jungle full of legal pitfalls, blind passages and tangled vines ready to trip the unwary venturer at every step. As one commentator suggests, the Protocol regime's language on LULUCF is 'complex, disjointed and inaccessible'.2 Even the secretariat to the Convention admitted in 1997 that terminology associated with sinks can be confusing and that precision in the use of terminology will be very important in the continuing discussion of 'sinks'.3 The tortuous path of defining activities and accounting systems under Article 3(3), 3(4) and 3(7) of the Protocol reached some level of finality at COP-7. Whether this 'sense of finality' continues through to COP/MOP-1 remains to be seen. Many more pitfalls await in the LULUCF debate. Annex I parties are likely to continue to find new formulations in order to gain as much as possible from carbon sequestration activities rather than reducing their emissions. The next key step will be to define the modalities for including afforestation and reforestation in the clean development mechanism.

3414514,"The practice of responsible research and innovation in ""climate engineering""","Sunlight reflection and carbon removal proposals for ""climate engineering"" (CE) confront governance challenges that many emerging technologies face: their futures are uncertain, and by the time one can discern their shape or impacts, vested interests may block regulation, and publics are often left out of decision-making about them. In response to these challenges, ""responsible research and innovation"" (RRI) has emerged as a framework to critique and correct for technocratic governance of emerging technologies, and CE has emerged as a prime case of where it can be helpfully applied. However, a critical lens is rarely applied to RRI itself. In this review, we first survey how RRI thinking has already been applied to both carbon removal and sunlight reflection methods for climate intervention. We examine how RRI is employed in four types of activities: Assessment processes and reports, principles and protocols for research governance, critical mappings of research, and deliberative and futuring engagements. Drawing upon this review, we identify tensions in RRI practice, including whether RRI forms or informs choices, the positionalities of RRI practitioners, and ways in which RRI activities enable or disable particular climate interventions. Finally, we recommend that RRI should situate CE within the long arc of sociotechnical proposals for addressing climate change, more actively connect interrogations of the knowledge economy with reparative engagements, include local or actor-specific contexts, design authoritative assessments grounded in RRI, and go beyond treating critique and engagement as ""de facto"" governance.

1810417,NEW DIMENSIONS IN LAND TENURE - THE CURRENT STATUS AND ISSUES SURROUNDING CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN REGIONAL AUSTRALIA,"Carbon sequestration became topical following the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (United Nations, 1992) and Kyoto Protocol (United Nations, 1998) which identified emissions trading as a mechanism to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In Australia a legislative framework was established to recognise carbon in forestry as a property right to enable participation in emissions trading schemes. Carbon rights offer rural landholders the opportunity to generate an alternative income stream on their land. However, there are considerable complexities surrounding carbon rights which are generally poorly understood, including the importance of the carbon agreement where the carbon rights are transferred to a third party. This paper builds on PhD research and provides a description of the substance and form of the carbon right in Australia and proposes a series of issues to consider for inclusion in a carbon agreement.",Regional development; Carbon right; Carbon sequestration; Carbon farming,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8265659809112549,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
5337647,Tropical Forest Landscape Restoration in Indonesia: A Review,"Indonesia has the second-largest biodiversity of any country in the world. Deforestation and forest degradation have caused a range of environmental issues, including habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity, deterioration of water quality and quantity, air pollution, and increased greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. Forest restoration at the landscape level has been conducted to balance ecological integrity and human well-being. Forest restoration efforts are also aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and are closely related to Indonesia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) from the forestry sector. The purpose of this paper is to examine the regulatory, institutional, and policy aspects of forest restoration in Indonesia, as well as the implementation of forest restoration activities in the country. The article was written using a synoptic review approach to Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR)-related articles and national experiences. Failures, success stories, and criteria and indicators for forest restoration success are all discussed. We also discuss the latest silvicultural techniques for the success of the forest restoration program. Restoration governance in Indonesia has focused on the wetland ecosystem such as peatlands and mangroves, but due to the severely degraded condition of many forests, the government has by necessity opted for active restoration involving the planting and establishment of livelihood options. The government has adapted its restoration approach from the early focus on ecological restoration to more forest landscape restoration, which recognizes that involving the local community in restoration activities is critical for the success of forest restoration. © 2022 by the authors.

218618,Climate change and forestry: An introduction,"Climate change is one of the most significant global challenges of our time, and addressing it requires the urgent formulation of comprehensive and effective policy responses. A changing climate affects nearly every sector of the world's economy and is intricately intertwined with other major environmental threats such as population growth, desertification and land degradation, air and water pollution, loss of biodiversity, and deforestation. To date, most of the international attention directed toward combating climate change has been strikingly insufficient and focused primarily on the industrial and energy sectors. The agriculture, forestry, and other land use sector-AFOLU in current climate policy jargon-has so far been treated as an unwelcome distraction from tackling industrialand energy-related emissions, rather than being seen as an integral part of the climate change problem for which we must develop comprehensive solutions.1 The resulting bias has led international climate negotiators to disregard t he major role forests and agricultural systems play in climate change. In the context of the Kyoto Protocol, widespread controversies and a lack of knowledge made negotiators agree to too little too late.2 This result is not withstanding the recognition in 1997 that, with the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol, any attempt to stabilize atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations will have to bring land-use-related emissions and removals into the equation. According to a 2006 study led by former World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern, the costs of reducing the effects of climate change can be significantly lowered if reduced deforestation and reforestation options are used effectively: ""Curbing deforestation is a highly cost-effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and has the potential to offer significant reductions fairly quickly. It also helps preserve biodiversity and protect soil and water quality. Encouraging new forests and enhancing the potential of soils to store carbon offer further opportunities to reverse emissions from land use change."" The idea for this book was triggered by the conviction that an effective post- Kyoto agreement must include a comprehensive system that allows for the accounting of land-use-related emissions and removals and establishes incentives to reduce emissions from deforestation. With a view to the forthcoming debate, we thought the time was ripe to compile existing knowledge, expertise, and experience and make it available in one volume. At the same time we sought to produce a practical reference manual outlining the history of AFOLU in international climate change negotiations, identifying key lessons learned from implementing the various policy frameworks and from actual forestry project experience to date, and drawing on all this to propose solutions for how best to move forward. This book has benefited from contributions and input by the leading forestry and climate change experts in government, international organizations, academe, civil society, and the private sector. In this chapter we provide a short overview of the role of forestry and agriculture in current climate policies-a recurring theme throughout the book. Like the other contributors, we focus our review on potential approaches to incorporating carbon sequestration and emission avoidance into emerging climate policy frameworks, rather than addressing the scientific debate that has surrounded the topic of climate change and forestry, which has already been written about at length.

5343039,A STUDY ON THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR CARBON CAPTURE AND STORAGE IN TAIWAN,"The World Energy Outlook 2019 report published by the IEA pointed out that in order to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions to the 2°C scenario (2DS) target by 2050, greenhouse gas reduction technologies such as energy efficiency improvement, renewable energy development, and carbon capture and storage are needed. Among them, the reduction potential effect contributed by carbon capture and storage technology will account for 9%. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is regarded as an important key technology for carbon reduction internationally. From the past experience of. cases of international promotion of CCS projects, it can be seen that most of the technical and non-technical difficulties will be encountered in the process of carbon dioxide geological storage projects. The non-technical difficulties are mainly unclear regulations and need to be overcome gradually. According to the international legalization process and experience of CCS, the issues of capture and transportation can usually be managed by current laws and regulations, but the storage technology involves a wide range of aspects, so it is the priority research direction for laws and regulations of various countries, and geological storage is the main focus. There are no relevant regulations that can be followed in the carbon storage stage in our country. Therefore, we will follow the experience and logic of the international formulation of CCS regulations to explore the short, medium and long-term direction of Taiwan’s regulations. © 2022, National Taiwan University of Science and Technology.

572757,More than CO2: a broader paradigm for managing climate change and variability to avoid ecosystem collapse,"Climate change policies currently focus on reducing the concentration of industrial atmospheric greenhouse gases due to burning fossil fuels and deforestation, but pay limited attention to feedbacks between the land surface and the climate system. In tropical and subtropical regions, forests and woodlands play an important role in the climate system by buffering climate extremes, maintaining the hydrological cycle and sequestering carbon. Despite the obvious significance of these feedbacks to the functioning of the climate system, deforestation continues apace. It is critical, therefore, that a broader focus be developed that includes the restoration of feedbacks between vegetation and climate. In this paper, we present a synthesis of the best available, policy-relevant science on the feedbacks between the land surface and the climate system, with a focus on tropical and subtropical regions. On the basis of this science, we argue for a stronger integration of land-use and climate-change policies. These policies need to include a virtual halt to all deforestation and an acceleration of investment in strategic reforestation, supported by a comprehensive global forest monitoring program. Without these actions, the degradation of the Earth's ecosystems will become exacerbated as their resilience is eroded by accelerated changes in temperature, precipitation and extreme weather events.",,Review,2010.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8255237936973572,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The WRI CCS project was initiated to develop stakeholder consensus on policies and procedures for safe and effective demonstration and deployment of technology. This effort is taking place in the context of rapidly changing policy arena.

5274168,The politics of carbon capture and storage: How interests have outstripped economics in shaping the evolution of a technology,"It is not just economics and technology but stakeholder interests which have shaped the evolution of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology as an option with a portfolio of low-carbon technologies. We trace how over the course of the 2000s, CCS went from largely unknown to being seen as a flexible, dispatchable technology applicable to coal, gas or biomass, which could address concerns over security of supply with minimal disruption to the existing power system and business models while addressing hard-to-abate sectors including heat and process industries. Four general themes are identified as explaining why the politics of CCS has been so difficult: (i) there is no pressure for politicians or other stakeholders to seek more efficient solutions; (ii) the lack of a coherent logic or overarching industrial policy narrative for supporting CCS, except perhaps in a few isolated locations; (iii) the nature of CCS requires a much larger initial investment and greater systems integration than other low-carbon options; and (iv) changing energy industry business models, which, over the past decade, had eroded some of the factors that had worked in favour of CCS. © Marc Ozawa, Jonathan Chaplin, Michael Pollitt, David Reiner and Paul Warde 2019.",,Book Chapter,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8254613876342773,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This ideal has been widely recognized in prior academic work. How, though, in a practical sense, is this deliberative aspect of CDR governance to be understood? In this policy brief, we look at the future incorporation of carbon removal pledges into the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of countries under the Paris Agreement, and we argue for and explore a deliberative orientation when it comes to the inclusion of CDR into country-level climate change response goals.

17466,The climate convention and evolution of the market for forest-based carbon offsets,"Since the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in 1992, policy developments associated with the role of forests in mitigating atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases have been both rapid and complex. The Kyoto Protocol, with its binding commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mentions afforestation, reforestation and deforestation, among others, as land use activities to be considered in efforts to achieve the framework's aims. Included in the Kyoto Protocol are three flexibility mechanisms designed to facilitate the realization of emission reduction targets. The exact definition of how forestry can be included under the protocol is not entirely clear and is open to different interpretations. This is particularly true for the eligibility of land use based activities under the Clean Development Mechanism. Despite these uncertainties, an increasing number of forestry-based emission reduction projects have been established in parallel with the ongoing policy developments. To date, more than 40 forestry projects have been established with the main objective of fixing carbon or preventing its release to the atmosphere. Although the market for forestry-based carbon offsets is still dependent on policy decisions, there is potential for considerable infusion of capital into the forest sector. For such investment, foresters need greater understanding of carbon markets and the mechanisms for credit transactions, and of how this new commodity will affect management practices. This article reviews the evolution of the negotiation process and how it has affected the market for carbon offsets and greenhouse gas reductions. Some of the trends and facts discussed may change following the second part of the sixth Conference of the Parties to UNFCCC (COP-6), scheduled to take place in July 2001 shortly after the article went to press.",,JOUR,2001.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.825335681438446,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
208339,"Carbon capture and storage in the UK and Germany: easier task, stronger commitment?","A successful carbon capture and storage (CCS) policy and programme is widely considered essential to curbing carbon dioxide emissions. What explains the strikingly different policy outcomes in two key European Union political heavyweights and coal economies, the UK and Germany? The UK has decided to contract two specific CCS projects, with explicit timelines for realisation; Germany has made no such decisions. From scrutiny of official documents and in-depth high-level interviews, it was found that the UK has more favourable structural capacity, including offshore storage capacity (which evokes less conflict) and significant oil-industry expertise, and thus an easier task. Moreover, this structural capacity has interacted with a solid political commitment to bring CCS forward in the UK, including specific, multistage funding and a high-level drive to develop CCS, especially after 2009. In Germany, by contrast, CCS has encountered increasing local and central opposition since 2009, with the Energiewende and renewables being accorded priority.",CCS; climate-change mitigation; environmental policy; energy sector,Article,2015.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8253257870674133,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas and a reduction in its concentration in the atmosphere through geological storage has been highlighted as an important initiative. As this is a little researched technology there is a lack of specific regulation to accompany its large scale usage. However, some developed countries have already structured their CGS regulatory framework. According to international studies one basic aspect in building a CGS regulatory structure lies in its correlation with natural gas and oil regulation. This article presents a regulatory framework Brazilian CGS proposal and suggests the creation of a new law on the subject and the development of its main regulatory mechanisms. The methodology used in this article is based on a review of literature and comparative analysis. A survey of the existing Brazilian legal framework on oil and gas was made.

However, translating national policy to stand level forest management can be difficult. As an example of how a national policy can be put into action, we examined three case studies in which a desired future condition is evaluated at the national, region, and local scale. We chose to use carbon sequestration as the desired future condition because climate change has become a major area of concern during the last decade. Several studies have determined that the 193 million acres of US national forest land currently sequester 11 to 15% of the total carbon emitted as a nation. This paper provides a framework by which national scale strategies for maintaining or enhancing forest carbon sequestration is translated through regional considerations and local constraints in adaptive management practices. Although this framework used the carbon sequestration as a case study, this framework could be used with other national level priorities such as the National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA) or the Endangered Species Act (ESA).",,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8241700530052185,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Across the United States, governments and corporations are adopting positions with the intent to reach zero GHG emissions in some specified year. The first section of this article clarifies how GHG emitting and carbon removing technologies are involved in the concept of net zero GHG emissions. Following that is a discussion of the precautionary principle that needs to be adopted for climate change mitigation. The precautionary principle originated when it became understood that scientific proof of the causes and extent of harmful environmental damage was often not possible until after it was too late to prevent the damage. In turn, analysis should be carried into EISs, which are documents that specify the impact of proposed projects on the environment.

5343571,"Decentralization of forest governance in Peninsular Malaysia: The case of peatland swamp forest in North Selangor, Malaysia","The peatland swamp forests (PSFs) represent a unique wetland ecosystem of distinctive hydrology, home to unique and rare habitats and species, and globally significant stores of soil carbon. Although Malaysia has significant amount of global PSF, a huge area has been converted mainly to agriculture, oil palm, and infrastructure development. The destruction of PSFs not only affects the environment but also affects the communities living in and around the PSFs, who rely on PSF ecosystem services for their livelihoods. To conserve PSFs and to sustain their ecological and socioeconomic functions, the Selangor State Forestry Department in collaboration with Global Environment Center (GEC, an NGO), local communities and other stakeholders recently introduced decentralized forest governance aiming at community-based restoration of PSF and uplifting local development. However, the understandings of decentralization approach in peatland forest governance and their outcomes are very little. Hence, this article reviews the state of decentralized peatland forest governance and its outcomes in terms of PSF conservation and local development through an extensive survey of available relevant literature. The study confirms that the forestry department delegated limited authority to the GEC for PSF restoration and stakeholders’ engagement. The GEC built social capital in the form of local associations and networks with corporate agencies, government and international bodies, and environmental enthusiasts. The regular participation of multistakeholders in reforestation activities and locals’ involvement in awareness and motivational events created a conducive environment for sustainable PSF conservation. Even though local people participate in rehabilitation activities, they have no real participation on program decision-making. Community development activities are also very limited. So sustainability of this collaboration remains a major challenge. The review concludes by noting that to make decentralized peatland forest governance effective and sustainable a strong forestry department-community-NGO partnership is needed; more socioeconomic activities and an institutional framework are of utmost importance. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",,Book Chapter,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.823576033115387,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

A legacy of unsustainable shellfish harvesting, shoreline development, and water pollution degraded the area. Dense human population and cumulative impacts of human uses continue to affect the site. Since acquiring the property, the Conservancy has worked with local communities and governments to implement shellfish and seagrass restoration projects within and outside of what is now the Great South Bay Marine Conservation Area. The Conservancy has also worked with stakeholders to address and improve environmental conditions within the watershed of Great South Bay. Several types of protected area governance incentives have been employed at the site, including economic (financing and staffing for restoration), knowledge (outreach regarding restored habitats), legal (private rights and enforcement) and participative (transparent and inclusive decision-making). Strengthening legal and regulatory policies that provide formal government support for the site would improve the likelihood of long-term success. While concerns about private protected areas exist, the Conservancy's Great South Bay Marine Conservation Area is one of several examples around the world of successful protection of the marine environment by a private entity.

We examine how the variations in the institutional arrangements related to the carbon finance aspects of projects affect the opportunities for poor rural producers involved, or those living in the vicinity of projects. Evidence is drawn from a review of three forest carbon projects in Uganda, based on qualitative stakeholder interviews and supported by policy documents and literature. Three aspects of project institutions are discussed; actors, rules and links to existing external institutions. The findings suggest that supporting such projects with carbon finance can have some positive impacts on opportunities through improved monitoring, but that considerable progress needs to be made in balancing the interests of project financers with those of the communities involved and improving policy coordination with existing institutions external to projects. We suggest that these lessons are particularly transferable to the growing number of REDD+ approaches that are strongly performance based or funded through carbon markets, and implemented through direct payment systems between buyers and local producer groups or individuals. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Agroforestry; Carbon forestry; Collaborative forest management; Development; Rules,JOUR,2011.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8223679661750793,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
757676,Geoengineering the oceans: An emerging frontier in international climate change governance,"International climate change policy is increasingly reliant upon future large-scale removal and sequestration of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. Assumptions on the development of ‘negative emissions’ technologies are built into recent IPCC emissions modelling and the 2015 Paris Agreement. Terrestrial proposals, such as bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, may be of limited benefit as the estimated land required would be vast and may negatively impact upon food security. The world’s oceans could play an important role in meeting international climate change targets. ‘Marine geoengineering’ is being proposed to enhance the oceans capacity to sequester emissions and enhance the Earth’s albedo.

679264,Ocean fertilisation and climate change: The need to regulate emerging high seas uses,"Geo-engineering and environmental modification techniques are increasingly being proposed as climate change mitigation strategies. Ocean fertilisation has been promoted as a simple solution to the problem of increasing atmospheric CO2 levels. However, neither its environmental safety nor its efficacy has been adequately assessed. This article examines the legality of ocean fertilisation under the law of the sea and concludes that it is subject to regulation under the London Convention and London Protocol as its potential for harm is contrary to the aims of these agreements. Hence, the sale of carbon offsets to fund ocean fertilisation activities should be prohibited unless and until an adequate risk assessment based on independent peer-reviewed science has established that the benefits outweigh the potential for harm, and appropriate regulation is in place to ensure that real, measurable, long-term CO2 sequestration can be independently verified. The initial uncertainties surrounding the appropriate regulatory regime for ocean fertilisation highlight the need for a comprehensive global regime for the prior assessment and on-going monitoring of existing, new and emerging high seas activities and uses to ensure they do not have adverse impacts on marine biodiversity and the marine environment in areas beyond national jurisdiction. © 2008 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers.",,JOUR,2008.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8221404552459717,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
397212,The Dilemma of Fossil Fuel Use and Global Climate Change,"Fossil fuels present the difficult-to-reconcile dilemma that the energy systems of today's society dictate that we use great quantities of fossil fuels to produce the energy we need, but their use results in the liberation of large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is one of the so-called “greenhouse gases”. Certain models predict that uncontrolled releases of greenhouse gases could result in unacceptable increases in global mean temperature. This dilemma is examined and a method of management of the use of fossil fuels is presented that will help to mitigate the problems their use creates. The challenge is to avoid the dilemma by technology and policy intervention so that fossil fuels are used to the net benefit of society and its environment. We should take those low-cost measures that slow greenhouse gas emissions, and we should be prepared technologically to accomplish much larger reductions if necessary. At present, our technological insurance is not in place, but the opportunities for improvement are great, even for fossil fuels. Several low-cost actions that can be taken in the near term include the establishment of policies including R&amp;D that encourage the development of more efficient and economical end-use and conversion technologies (e.g., more efficient gas turbines, fuel cells, oxygen-blown gasifiers, and processes for producing hydrogen from fossil sources); more intensive R&amp;D to accelerate the development of better nonfossil sources including direct solar, biomass, and other renewables, fission, and fusion; policies that encourage the substitution of hydrogen-rich for hydrogen-lean fuels and expansion of the natural gas system, particularly in developing nations; cooperation by western industrialized countries in providing technical assistance to developing and Eastern European countries for producing energy technologies that are both economically and environmentally more attractive, including expanding the development and use of the natural gas resources of the former Soviet Union; R&amp;D to increase our understanding of the global cycle of CO2 releases to the atmosphere and its removal by the oceans and by terrestrial ecosystems so that climate stabilization targets and policies can be better established; and experiments with CO2 recovery and sequestration techniques so that the economic and environmental impacts are better understood. © 1993, American Chemical Society.

4379716,"Assessing negative carbon dioxide emissions from the perspective of a national ""fair share"" of the remaining global carbon budget","We present an assessment of the plausible Paris-alignedfair sharenett cumulative carbon dioxide (CO2) quota for an example nation state, the Republic of Ireland. ByParis-aligned, we mean consistent with the Paris Agreement adopted at the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, at Paris, France, in December 2015 (UNFCCC2015). We compare and contrast this quota with both the aspirations expressed in the current IrishNational Policy Positionand current national emission projections. The fair share quota is assessed as a maximum of c. 391 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO(2)), equal to 83 tonnes of carbon dioxide (tCO(2)) per capita, from 2015, based on a precautionary estimate of the global carbon budget (GCB) and specific interpretation of global equity. Given Ireland's high current CO(2)per capita emission rate, this would correspond to sustained year-on-year reductions in nett annual CO(2)emissions of over - 11% per year (beginning as of 2016). By contrast, the CO(2)mitigation target indicated in the National Policy Position corresponds to nett annual reduction rates in the range of only -4.7% per year (low ambition) up to a maximum of - 8.3% per year (high ambition), and projections based on current and immediately planned mitigation measures indicate the possibility, instead, of sustainedincreasesin emissions at a rate of the order of + 0.7% per year. Accordingly, there is a large gap between Paris-aligned ambition and current political and policy reality on the ground, with a significant risk of early emergence of ""CO(2)debt"" and tacit reliance on rapid deployment of currently speculative (at a relevant scale and feasible cost) negative CO(2)emission technologies to actively remove CO(2)from the atmosphere. While the detailed policy situation will clearly differ from country to country, we suggest that this methodology, and itsCO(2)debtframing, may be usefully applied in other individual countries or regions. We recommend that such framing be incorporated explicitly into a global mitigation strategy via the statements of nationally determined contributions required to be submitted and updated by all parties under the Paris Agreement processes.",Climate change mitigation; Global carbon budget; National carbon quota; Climate policy; Carbon debt; Negative carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon dioxide removal,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8214709162712097,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
710088,Economic instruments for mitigating carbon emissions: scaling up carbon finance in China's buildings sector,"The relevance and cost-effectiveness are key criteria for policymakers to select appropriate policy and economic instruments for reducing carbon emissions. Here we assess the applicability of carbon finance instruments for the improvement in building energy efficiency by adopting the high efficiency standards as well as advanced energy supply systems, building on a case study in a northern city in China. We find that upgrading the current Chinese BEE standard to one of the best practices in the world coupled with the state-of-the-art energy supply system implies an abatement cost at 16US$/tCO(2), which is compatible with the international carbon market price. The institutional reorganization turns out to be indispensable to facilitate the implementation of the proposed scheme of local government-led energy efficiency programme in the form of programmatic CDM in China's buildings sector. We show that with international support such as carbon finance, the BEE improvement will facilitate city's transition to low-carbon supply in the longer term. More importantly, it is argued that demand-side energy performance improvement in buildings should be considered a prerequisite to shifting low-carbon energy supply technologies such as fuel-switching, renewable power generation and Carbon Capture and Storage to address climate mitigation in light of cost-effectiveness and environmental integrity.",,text,2011.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.821230947971344,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
413634,The clean development mechanism: Making it operational,"The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is a facility for trading 'certified emission reductions (CERs) between developing and developed countries, thus saving non-renewable carbon emissions by promoting renewable energy, energy efficiency and/or carbon sequestration projects in LDC's. The purpose of the CDM is to help these latter countries meet their obligations under the Kyoto Protocol while at the same time promoting ""sustainable"" development in the former countries, thereby reducing the build-up of greenhouse gases (GHG). This paper examines the progress in achieving a workable CDM in time for the first commitment period (2008-2012), and the kinds of initiatives that can be pursued in the agricultural, land-use and forestry sector in tropical countries. The critical element for the success of the CDM is the participation of a broad cross-section of buyers (ultimately from developed countries) and sellers (from developing countries) of CERs. Trading is the final step, which starts with project formulation, through successful implementation and then certification. This paper lays out a market-based framework for promoting CDM transactions between private sector project developers and traders and public sector policy makers, with regulators, governed by CDM rules, overseeing the smooth running of the CDM. However, as there are numerous players; it is proposed that trial CDM projects be demonstrated with the support of National/International bodies to iron out the problems and come up with practical solutions so that carbon trading can become a reality. Most rules for the CDM were clarified at the 7th Conference of Parties (CP) in October/ November of 2001 in Marrakesh. An executive Board (EB) was appointed and this EB is in charge of proposing workable ground rules to promote the CDM. These have to be submitted for approval by the 8th CP in late 2002. Three broad kinds of projects qualify for the CDM, these are: renewable energy projects that will be alternatives to fossil fuel projects; sequestration projects that offset GHG emissions; and energy efficient projects that will decrease the emissions of GHG. It is possible to have a combination of these initiatives. A fourth type covering GHG reduction is omitted. As elaborated in the text, in order to qualify for the CDM, the proposed projects may have to have additional costs when compared to the alternative(s). Two time frames have been agreed for CDM projects to qualify for the first commitment period, namely 7 years (with an option of two 7-year renewals) and 10 years. Also, for land-use, land-use change and forestry projects only afforestation/reforestation initiatives are recognized as being permissible for the first commitment period. These rules seem rather shortsighted, as forestry and/or renewable energy projects usually require more than 21 years to be fully effective. Also, the major cause of deforestation is clearing land for agriculture, not harvesting wood. Therefore, improving agricultural productivity may be the best way to reduce deforestation and its subsequent release of GHGs. These conditionalities should be re-examined when rules for the second commitment period are decided. However, various agricultural and land-use projects are discussed under the existing guidelines which could qualify as CDM projects in the first period.",,Article,2004.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8210182785987854,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

We understand the term Anthropocene' to be characterised by crisis, on one hand, and by promise, on the other. In particular, we aim to raise doubts on the dominant perspective on the organisation of climate engineering, which assumes these approaches to be regulated through legalistic means.

194472,Ocean iron fertilization: Why further research is needed,"Despite large uncertainties in the fertilization efficiency, natural iron fertilization studies and some of the purposeful iron enrichment studies have demonstrated that Southern Ocean iron fertilization can lead to a significant export of carbon from the sea surface to the ocean interior. From an economic perspective the potential of ocean iron fertilization (OIF) is far from negligible in relation to other abatement options. Comparing the range of cost estimates to the range of estimates for forestation projects they are in the same order of magnitude, but OIF could provide more carbon credits even if high discount rates are used to account for potential leakage and non-permanence. However, the uncertainty about undesired adverse effects of purposeful iron fertilization on marine ecosystems and biogeochemistry has led to attempts to ban commercial and, to some extent, scientific experiments aimed at a better understanding of the processes involved, effectively precluding further consideration of this mitigation option. As regards the perspective of public international law, the pertinent agreements dealing with the protection of the marine environment indicate that OIF is to be considered as lawful if and to the extent to which it represents legitimate scientific research. In this respect, the precautionary principle can be used to balance the risks arising out of scientific OIF activities for the marine environment with the potential advantages relevant to the objectives of the climate change regime. As scientific OIF experiments involve only comparatively small negative impacts within a limited marine area, further scientific research must be permitted to explore the carbon sequestration potential of OIF in order to either reject this concept or integrate it into the flexible mechanisms contained in the Kyoto Protocol.

76866,Stranded on a low-carbon planet: Implications of climate policy for the phase-out of coal-based power plants,"Limiting global warming to 2 degrees C will likely entail the complete phase-out of coal-based electricity generation without carbon capture and storage (CCS). The timing and rate of this phase-out will depend on the stringency of near-term climate policy and will have important implications for the stranding of coal power plant capacity without CCS. The objectives of this paper are to better understand the relationship between near-term climate policy and stranded coal capacity (assuming a long-term goal of limiting warming to 2 degrees C) and to explore strategies for reducing stranded capacity. Our analysis suggests that strengthening near-term climate policy (i.e., lowering the global greenhouse gas emission target in 2030) generally reduces stranded coal capacity and its costs. An effective strategy for reducing stranded capacity is to minimize new construction of coal capacity without CCS, which can be accomplished by reducing electricity demand through energy intensity improvements and/or by keeping existing plants operating through lifetime extensions. Another strategy, providing emission exemptions for pre-existing coal plants (i.e., grandfathering), would eliminate stranded capacity, but also decreases the likelihood of achieving the 2 degrees C target. Finally, the ability of CCS retrofits to significantly reduce stranded capacity depends on how quickly the technology can be deployed. (C) 2014 The Authors.

5344058,Peatlands Restoration Policies in Indonesia: Success or Failure?,"This paper describes and analyzes the peatland restoration policy undertaken by the Indonesian government. The Indonesian government has since implemented the first phase of peatland restoration in 2016-2020. It can be said that the restoration of the peatland area of 2.4 million hectares faces several problems. One of the main problems is the unsuccessful restoration of peatlands in the company's concession areas. Companies that are obliged to restore peatlands in their concessions do not comply with regulations set by the government. As the program's leader, the Peatland Restoration Agency is powerless to do much because its authority extends only to supervising the company's concession area. Restoration of peatlands outside the concession area (cultivated land and protected forest) can be satisfied because the government can directly restore these peatlands.

570813,Perspectives on CO2 capture and storage,"The last decade has seen a significant increase in the research and development of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technology. CCS is now considered to be one of the key options for climate change mitigation. This perspective provides a brief summary of the state of the art regarding CCS development and discusses the implications for the further development of CCS, particularly with respect to climate change policy. The aim is to provide general perspectives on CCS, although examples used to illustrate the prospects for CCS are mainly taken from Europe. The rationale for developing CCS should be the over-abundance of fossil fuel reserves (and resources) in a climate change context. However, CCS will only be implemented if society is willing to attach a sufficiently high price to CO2 emissions. Although arguments have been put forward both in favor and against CCS, the author of this perspective argues that the most important outcome from the successful commercialization of CCS will be that fossil-fuel-dependent economies will find it easier to comply with stringent greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets. In contrast, failure to implement CCS will require that the global community agrees almost immediately to start phasing out the use of fossil fuels; such an agreement seems more unrealistic than reaching a global agreement on stringent GHG reductions. Thus, in the near term, it is crucial to initiate demonstration projects, such as those supported by the EU. If this is not done, there is a risk that the introduction of CCS will be significantly delayed. Among the stakeholders in CCS technologies (R&D actors in industry and academia), the year 2020 is typically considered to be the year in which CCS will be commercially available. Considering the lead times for CCS development and the slow pace of implementation of climate policy (post-Copenhagen), the target year of 2020 seems rather optimistic.

In this context, a review of the current and future mechanisms for such support is outlined. Two important applications of CCS are considered further: CCS with CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) and CCS on bioenergy emission sources (BECCS). Both technologies may be key to supporting near-term deployment of CCS in developing countries because of certain advantages they hold over other CCS applications. (C) 2014 The Authors.

We explore the most cost-effective way of targeted CO2 abatement to reach specific climate stabilization targets by comparing the climate policies including subsidies for alternative energy, tax for fossil fuel and a combination of both. We also investigate the impacts of these policy instruments on the energy demand, consumptions, R&D activities and the performances of various carbon-free energy technologies. The main findings are as follows: first, the subsidy policy alone never offers the cheapest option to meet the reduction targets, and the policy of carbon tax is proved to be the most cost-effective way of CO2 abatement. Second, subsidy plays a limit role in promoting R&D activities of non-carbon technologies, which are driven more by the mix policy. Third, we find that the implementation of carbon tax will largely promote the development of CCS, and the share of fossil technology equipped with CCS in total will have reached around 15% by the end of 21 century. Finally, the CO2 reduction ratio for CCS keeps increasing in the present of carbon tax, and pathway of carbon abatement contribution for CCS is hump-shaped when turning to the mix policy case.

As CCS has the greatest potential for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction, it gains a wide currency in the developed countries. However, the technology for CCS does not spread at the international level especially to the developing countries like South China Sea states. As the CO2 storage period is quite long and potential environmental risks involved, fully deployed CCS projects need not only the technological support but the appropriate legal and regulatory regime to safeguard CCS operations.

183664,International Transport of Captured CO2: Who Can Gain and How Much?,"If carbon capture and storage (CCS) is to become a viable option for low-carbon power generation, its deployment will require the construction of dedicated CO2 transport infrastructure. In a scenario of large-scale deployment of CCS in Europe by 2050, the optimal (cost-minimising) CO2 transport network would consist of large international bulk pipelines from the main CO2 source regions to the CO2 sinks in hydrocarbon fields and saline aquifers, which are mostly located in the North Sea. In this paper, we use a Shapley value approach to analyse the multilateral negotiation process that would be required to develop such jointly optimised CO2 infrastructure. First, we find that countries with excess storage capacity capture 38-45 % of the benefits of multilateral coordination, implying that the resource rent of a depleted hydrocarbon field (when used for CO2 storage) is roughly per barrel of original recoverable oil reserves, or per boe (barrel of oil equivalent) of original recoverable gas reserves. This adds 25-600 % to current estimates of CO2 storage cost. Second, countries with a strategic transit location capture 19 % of the rent in the case of national pipeline monopolies. Liberalisation of CO2 pipeline construction at EU level could eliminate the transit rent and is shown to reduce by two-thirds the differences between countries in terms of cost per tonne of CO2 exported. Reaching agreement on such liberalisation may be politically challenging, since the payoffs are shown to be strongly divergent across countries.",Carbon capture and storage; International negotiations; Network optimisation; Pipelines; Resource rent; Shapley value; Transit fee,Article,2014.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8176122307777405,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Taking Cearg State as an example and based on the Ceara State Energy Balances for 1980, 1984 and 1987, the Carbon (C-CO2) Emission Balances were drawn up covering these same years. An exercise was carried out in order to draw up carbon emissions mitigation proposals through both Environmental Education and reforestation policies replacing forest clearing. The first, environmental education and forest management practices, involves more efficient practices in the woody sector. The second, reforestation policies, instead of felling native forests for fuel-wood burned to produce charcoal, is discussed from the economic point of view.

603059,"Scandals, audits, and fictions: Linking climate change to Mexican forests","Over the past 10 years, Mexican officials and scientists have promoted the project of protecting Mexican forests in order to mitigate climate change, forests acting to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This article compares existing policies around mass reforestation and markets for environmental services, and their relationships to a policy in construction - Reduced Emissions through Degradation and Deforestation. Mass reforestation policies collapsed in the face of politicized audits and stories about corruption; markets for environmental services continued with little criticism, stabilized in part by the charisma of Reduced Emissions through Degradation and Deforestation policies. I explain the collapse of mass reforestation policies as being due to failed knowledge performances by officials and scientists; such failures are assessed by more or less skeptical publics who expect specific ways of performing credible public knowledge. Areas of nonknowledge can be tamed as calculable uncertainty, or alternatively transformed into ontological indeterminacy, scandals, and stories of corruption.

240978,Après Paris: Breakthrough innovation as the primary moral obligation of rich countries,"While the notion of differentiated responsibility has always included an element of technological transfer, the growing disparity between the deployment of non-scalable renewable energy sources in the rich countries and the massive expansion of fossil infrastructure elsewhere has brought new urgency to issues of climate leadership. Breakthrough innovation into technologies capable of providing an abundance of clean energy now appears necessary not only to broaden energy access but also to ensure that fossil fuels are quickly displaced globally (including in those countries that have failed to take climate change seriously). Moreover, it is reasonable to expect that a climatechanged world in itself will demand abundant energy to facilitate everything from carbon dioxide removal to mass desalination for agriculture and other adaptation measures. Considering the moral and political impossibility of treating sustained poverty as the “solution” to the climate crisis, this paper suggests that rich countries have a moral obligation to invest in breakthrough innovation into technologies that are compatible with a future global economic convergence around OECD-levels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,2016.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8163493275642395,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1824368,Blue Carbon: The Role Of The Ocean As A Climate Balance In The Mitigation Of Climate Change,"The impact of global climate change has been a particular concern of the world community and nations, including Indonesia. As an archipelagic country that has a wide range of natural resources and high biodiversity, Indonesia has great potential to be adversely affected by climate change and also has great potential to contribute in its mitigation and adaptation to its negative impacts. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) sets out several targets for reducing Green House Gas (GHG) emissions in the context of climate change mitigation. Blue carbon in Indonesia is stored in the marine environment and has great potential as an absorber or hoarder of carbon dioxide that can reduce GHG emissions. Indonesia's coastal and marine areas have the potential to absorb approximately 138 million tonnes of carbon equivalent per year or five times more than the potential absorption of tropical forest ecosystems in Indonesia. The carbon sequestration potential can reduce 25% of global carbon emissions. The amount of carbon storage shows that the ocean can play an important role in climate change mitigation. However, the complexity of blue carbon management and its implementation capacity still requires in-depth study. The analysis in this paper uses a form of normative legal research, which is done by analyzing related laws and regulations, using a problem statute approach and conceptual approach. Legal construction in the management of blue carbon is required as a form of protection of the marine environment as a climate balancer.",Blue Carbon; Policy; Climate Change; Sea; Mitigation,Proceedings Paper,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8159535527229309,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
630435,Targeting sustainable provision of forest ecosystem services with special focus on carbon sequestration,"Contemporary societies expect a range of services (including of carbon sequestration) to be supplied from forest ecosystems. Their growing societal importance is clearly reflected in policies. The conceptual framework for the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) states that people are integral parts of ecosystems and that a dynamic interaction exists between them and other parts of ecosystems. This approach encompasses social, economic and environmental interactions, and the dynamics and cross scale issues that have multiple outcomes. However, forest multifunctionality is a challenge since the combination of multiple ecosystem services may be very different and dependent on a high number of factors. Stakeholder priorities with respect to individual ecosystem services may be variable, as may be a range of stakeholders. Reflexive, participatory and multilevel governance, in a continuous process of its adjustment, needs therefore to be developed to enable forestry decision-makers to consider existing opinions and behavioural patterns of the diverse stakeholders who drive the forestry change and respond to it. In such a retrospective, numerous questions have arisen, among which the integration of carbon sequestration into multifunctional forestry is among priorities. Carbon forestry enables society to buy time for development of low carbon and decarbonisation technologies; while its integration into multifunctional land use offers innovation, employment and new markets, with locally and regionally oriented value chains. This particularly concerns remote areas where forestry could foster socio-economic development and combine it with the enhancement of nature and rural landscape. However, the question: how to multiply synergies and balance trade-offs merits attention. Fostering resilience of forestry systems to climate change necessitates the establishment of an appropriate framework, because, although multipurpose afforestation may result in lower rates of carbon sequestration, it is expected to be more attractive to people as it will provide additional benefits and will promote sustainable development. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",,Book Chapter,2013.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8155935406684875,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
77606,Policy and technological constraints to implementation of greenhouse gas mitigation options in agriculture,"A recent assessment of agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has demonstrated significant potential for mitigation, but suggests that the full mitigation will not be realized due to significant barriers to implementation. In this paper, we explore the constraints and barriers to implementation important for GHG mitigation in agriculture. We also examine how climate and non-climate policy in different regions of the world has affected agricultural GHG emissions in the recent past, and how it may affect emissions and mitigation implementation in the future. We examine the links between mitigation and adaptation and drives for sustainable development and the potential for agricultural GHG mitigation in the future. We describe how some countries have initiated climate and non-climate policies believed to have direct effects or synergistic effects on mitigating GHG emissions from agriculture. Global sharing of innovative technologies for efficient use of land resources and agricultural chemicals, to eliminate poverty and malnutrition, will significantly mitigate GHG emissions from agriculture. Previous studies have shown that as, less than 30% of the total biophysical potential for agricultural GHG mitigation might be achieved by 2030, due to price- and non-price-related barriers to implementation. The challenge for successful agricultural GHG mitigation will be to remove these barriers by implementing creative policies. Identifying policies that provide benefits for climate, as well as for aspects of economic, social and environmental sustainability, will be critical for ensuring that effective GHG mitigation options are widely implemented in the future.

However, due to illegal logging, fire and conversion into other land use, the peatlands in Indonesia are under serious threat. Efforts to restore Indonesia's tropical peatlands have been accelerated by the establishment of the Peatland Restoration Agency in early 2016. The restoration action policy includes the rewetting, revegetation and revitalisation of local livelihood (known as the 3Rs).

Ecosystem services focus on the functional significance of nature, striving for a stronger position for them in policy. How do ecosystem services relate to nature conservation and biodiversity? What is the meaning of valuation and monetizacion? First the background of the concept of ecosystem services and the various categories of ecosystem services are described. Using the case of CO2 sequestration for the Dutch situation shows how this concept might be put to practise. The case study shows how CO2 sequestration by forest and peat land ecosystems may be affected by man and how this relates to the total Dutch emission and the reduction target. It describes how these services can be valorized in monetary terms, including the role of policy. It appears that the Kyoto Protocol is sensitive to the area of forest, but not for the way forests are managed. Moreover, the Dutch implementation of the protocol is insensitive to the management of the peatland areas, whereas these areas emit considerable quantities of CO2.

228585,Can forestry gain from emissions trading? Rules governing sinks projects under the UNFCCC and the EU emissions trading system,"It is commonly agreed that protecting our global forests is key to reducing CO2 emissions from the biosphere. Especially in countries with a large forest cover, like Brazil or Indonesia, emissions from deforestation are the national key source of greenhouse gas emissions, by far more important than industrial or energy-related emissions. However, the answer to this problem is not straightforward. The hotly debated question among parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) within the negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol was whether changes in carbon stocks should be accounted for within the Kyoto framework. That is, the question was whether carbon removals by sinks would be rewarded and thus could be traded within the Kyoto emissions trading regime. The debate, under the cryptic heading 'Land use, land-use change and forestry' (LULUCF), centred around four issues: scale, non-permanence, uncertainty and the question of credibility. Furthermore, the question was raised whether or not CO2 removals by sinks in developing countries should also be able to generate credits to be used within the emissions trading regime. In this article, the solution that parties found to address these questions is described and analysed. First, the general approach chosen towards sinks is outlined. Second, the rules that govern forestry projects in developing countries are described, then the rules that LULUCF projects in developed countries would need to follow are briefly set out.

788472,BIOCHAR STANDARDIZATION AND LEGISLATION HARMONIZATION,"It is a relatively new concept to use biochar as soil amendment and for climate change mitigation. For this reason, the national and supranational legislation in the EU is not yet adequately prepared to regulate both the production and the application of biochar. Driven by this regulatory gap, voluntary biochar quality standards have been formed in Europe with the European Biochar Certificate, in the UK with the Biochar Quality Mandate and in the USA with the IBI Standard which is intended to be used internationally. In parallel to this, biochar producers and biochar users in a number of EU countries were partly successful in fitting the new biochar product into the existing national legislation for fertilisers, soil improvers and composts. The intended revision of the EC Regulation 2003/2003 on fertilisers offers the opportunity to regulate the use of biochar at the EU level. This publication summarizes the efforts on biochar standardization which have been carried out by voluntary products standards and illustrates existing legislation in EU member states, which apply to the production and use of biochar.

1836398,CCS in the Skagerrak/Kattegat-region - Assessment of an intraregional CCS infrastructure and legal framework,"This paper provides some initial results from the project ""CCS in the Skagerrak/Kattegat-region"" which is an intraregional CCS project partly funded by the EU. The project assesses the prospects for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) from industry and power plants located in the Skagerrak region which comprises northern Denmark, south-east coast of Norway and the west coast of Sweden. The project is a joint cooperation between universities, research institutes and industries in the region. The methodology used in one of the project work packages is presented together with some initial results on legal aspects. CCS in the Skagerrak region may potentially account for a third of combined emission reduction commitments by 2020 in the three countries involved in the project. Yet, much of the emissions in the region occur from industry (in addition to power plants) and it is still not clear how these industries will be treated under the ETS. Based on current knowledge, a good storage option would be in the Hanstholm aquifer on Denmark's northwest coast. The phasing-in of capture plants over time is central to the development of a cost efficient CCS infrastructure. However, many of the sources in the region are located at a port facilitating use of boat transport through the build-up period. The initial legal analysis show that significant regulatory uncertainties exist in the region with regard to CCS and it is not obvious that the implementation of the EU CCS directive into national law by June 2011 will alleviate these uncertainties. Finally, the project may provide a significant test case for what type of political and regulatory cooperation that will be required if CCS is to be deployed in a transboundary context under conditions of sufficient public acceptance and well-designed regulation.

This paper presents the different options of carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS) technologies regarding the legislative initiatives implemented in the new European energy policy. This new European energy strategy was established taking into consideration not only energy demand but also social and environmental requirements. Taking that into account, the different strategies adopted by the European energy council are discussed and an overview of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies-a mitigation strategy able to reduce greenhouse gas emissions-and the CO2 potential utilization were also addressed. Conventional and unconventional CO2 geological storage/sequestration reservoirs are analysed, taking into consideration the different properties of both types of reservoirs.

The potential that restoration holds for achieving both ecological and social goals can only be met through a shift toward people-centered restoration strategies. Toward this end, this paper synthesizes critical insights from a special issue on ""Restoration for whom, by whom"" to propose actionable ways to center humans and social dimensions in ecosystem restoration, with the aim of generating fair and sustainable initiatives. These rules respond to a relative silence on socio-political issues in di Sacco et al.'s ""Ten golden rules for reforestation to optimize carbon sequestration, biodiversity recovery and livelihood benefits"" on socio-political issues and offer complementary guidance to their piece. Arranged roughly in order from pre-intervention, design/initiation, implementation, through the monitoring, evaluation and learning phases, the 10 people-centered rules are: (1) Recognize diversity and interrelations among stakeholders and rightsholders'; (2) Actively engage communities as agents of change; (3) Address socio-historical contexts; (4) Unpack and strengthen resource tenure for marginalized groups; (5) Advance equity across its multiple dimensions and scales; (6) Generate multiple benefits; (7) Promote an equitable distribution of costs, risks, and benefits; (8) Draw on different types of evidence and knowledge; (9) Question dominant discourses; and (10) Practice inclusive and holistic monitoring, evaluation, and learning.

238941,International forest carbon sequestration in a post-kyoto agreement,"Introduction: Forest carbon management must be an important element of any international agreement on climate change. Forest carbon flows comprise a significant part of overall global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While global forests as a whole may be a net sink (Nabours and Masera 2007), global emissions from deforestation contribute between 20 and 25 percent of all GHG emissions (Sedjo and Sohngen 2007, Skutsch et al. 2007). The size of the total global carbon pool in forest vegetation has been estimated at 359 gigatonnes of carbon (GtC), which compares to annual global carbon emissions from industrial sources of approximately 6.3 GtC (IPCC 2000). The potential impact on the global carbon cycle of both natural and anthropogenic changes in forests is enormous. An effective international forest carbon management regime must not only provide landowners and governments with incentives to protect and expand stocks of carbon, but must induce countries to enroll in the forest agreement in the first place. Ideally, a multilateral forest carbon program would also impose relatively low transaction costs even as it encourages decision makers to seek low-cost opportunities for sequestration. The current international regime, the Kyoto Protocol, has proven ineffective in this regard. There are three primary problems. First, the Annex I (industrialized) countries are required to include afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation in their national accounting. However, Article 3.3 of the Kyoto Protocol limits that accounting to changes that are “human-induced,” inviting endless arguments about which changes should be included. For example, one can make reasonable arguments both for and against, say, Canada's inclusion of continued northern forest growth as a “human-induced” change in its national carbon account. © Cambridge University Press 2010.",,Book Chapter,2009.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8119675517082214,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
3280411,The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme: critical review and future outlook for three design innovations,"The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS) broke new ground in ETS design. Drawing from analysis of core policy documentation, this paper examines the rationale, outcomes, and outlook for three key innovations - broad sectoral coverage with some upstream points of obligation, the absence of a hard limit on system emissions, and a two-part cost containment mechanism - following the first decade of operation. It also provides comparative assessment with the European Union Emissions Trading System and California Cap-and-Trade Program. The NZ ETS was designed around the principle of least-cost compliance with international responsibility targets and a core assumption that the Kyoto Protocol emissions market would converge toward an efficient emission price aligned with rising global mitigation ambition. This assumption did not become a reality. As a result, the NZ ETS has produced a functional cross-sector trading market but little incentive for domestic mitigation to date. In late 2019, amendments were introduced to reform sectoral coverage, unit supply, and price management features so the system will better support New Zealand's targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement and 2019 Zero Carbon Act. However, substantial technical and political challenges remain to set near-term domestic mitigation ambition, phase out industrial free allocation, determine the mitigation contribution from the land sector, and design the agricultural emissions pricing regime. The evolution of the NZ ETS, relative to other systems and in response to national circumstances, offers insights that can inform the future development of emissions trading globally. Key policy insights Since 2008, the NZ ETS has successfully pioneered broad cross-sector emissions trading with upstream energy-sector obligations and deforestation obligations with afforestation crediting. Pricing of biogenic agricultural emissions is anticipated from 2025. The government's failure to adapt unit supply and cost containment mechanisms to changing market conditions has undermined incentives for domestic mitigation, resulted in a large bank of participant-held emission units, and subjected the market to long-term policy uncertainty. A cap on auctioning and new price management features will better equip the NZ ETS to support New Zealand's domestic emission reduction targets, but strategic questions remain about the future role of the land sector.",Emissions trading; New Zealand; climate change; Kyoto Protocol; Paris Agreement; Zero Carbon Act,Review,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8112457394599915,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The signatory countries to the United Nations Convention on Climate Change agreed to organize the Technology Executive Committee and the Climate Technology Centre and Network. The objectives of this paper are twofold. The first objective is to show a broad landscape of barriers in technology development. The paper summarizes the results of key case studies that were conducted to uncover technology-specific barriers in technology development. These case studies include both technologies for industrial use such as wind, bio-energy and building energy efficiency and technologies for individual use such as Light Emitting Diodes and photovoltaic panels. The case studies also contain technologies at the innovation stage such as Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle and Carbon Capture and Storage. The second objective of this paper is to highlight and define roles of international institutions in overcoming identified barriers in clean energy technology development. In this paper four areas of focus for international institutions are discussed, including: 1) increasing R&D cooperation at the innovation stage, 2) facilitation of intellectual property rights, 3) supporting finance, and 4) enhancing the enabling environment at the diffusion stage.

435968,Developing policies for soil carbon management in tropical regions,"It is argued in this paper that two fundamental economic processes prevent resource-poor farmers in tropical countries from managing soil carbon in a sustainable manner. The first process is related to the fact that soil carbon and tropical forests are part of the natural capital of these countries and of the world community. As a consequence, the interests of resource-poor farmers in tropical countries, of these countries themselves and of the world community conflict. This implies that levels of adoption of sustainable soil carbon management practices which are optimal from the perspective of resource-poor farmers are sub-optimal from a regional and global perspective. The second process regards the nature of sustainable soil management practices. These practices are investments in natural capital which bring about net benefits to farmers only after four to six years. Absolute poverty levels in tropical countries make it very difficult for farmers to undertake such investments. It follows that even perfectly informed and rational resource-poor farmers will not voluntarily adopt socially optimal levels of soil carbon management in tropical countries. Policy interventions are a means of ensuring that soil carbon is managed in such a socially optimal and sustainable fashion in these countries. Two principles are proposed for developing effective, equitable and appropriate policy options. The first is the beneficiary-compensates principle, which requires that society in tropical countries and in industrialized countries should compensate resource-poor farmers in tropical countries for adopting soil carbon management practices. The second principle is that international and national policy options need to be well articulated and that sets of complementary policies should be put in place for seater effectiveness. Policies alleviating rural poverty and pressures to deforest are as necessary as policies specifically targeted at soil carbon management. Finally, research priorities for soil and biological scientists so derived from the analysis. These priorities necessitate the creation of interdisciplinary teams of soil, biological and social scientists. This is perhaps an even greater challenge for the scientific community than the achievement of the research agenda itself.

There are three possible options for reconciling the gap between coal-power expansion plans and CO2 reduction scenarios: First, reduction targets could be scaled back such that targets are achieved at a later date than currently foreseen. A second option would be to make use of more advanced coal technologies. As shown in this paper, however, the second option is quite expensive and would only have a moderate impact on CO2 emissions. A third option is the introduction of carbon capture and storage (CCS). This paper concludes that climate policy in China will likely be a process of small and incremental steps, with emissions reductions taking probably longer than currently forecasted. Even if CCS technology is introduced in the next two decades, absolute reductions in CO2 emissions can first be expected after 2030.",China; climate policy; low carbon economy; clean coal technologies,Proceedings Paper,2014.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.8104274272918701,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5273627,Beyond “Net-Zero”: A Case for Separate Targets for Emissions Reduction and Negative Emissions,"Targets and accounting for negative emissions should be explicitly set and managed separately from existing and future targets for emissions reduction. Failure to make such a separation has already hampered climate policy, exaggerating the expected future contribution of negative emissions in climate models, while also obscuring the extent and pace of the investment needed to deliver negative emissions. Separation would help minimize the negative impacts that promises and deployments of negative emissions could have on emissions reduction, arising from effects such as temporal trade-offs, excessive offsetting, and technological lock-in. Benefits for international, national, local, organizational, and sectoral planning would arise from greater clarity over the role and timing of negative emissions alongside accelerated emissions reduction.

This special issue of Global Environmental Change brings together leading scholars to analyze the politics, policy and regulation of CCS in cross-country comparisons as well as in a global context. The aim is to contribute on two fronts: first, by applying concepts, theories and methodologies from the social and policy sciences, to elucidate how societies are engaging with CCS as a mitigation option; and secondly, to point toward a future research agenda which, while exploring basic aspects of technology development as situated in a social context, would also be aligned with the needs of the climate and environmental policy community. The contributions address at least one of three inter-related research areas; CCS and the emergence of long-term climate and energy strategies; regulation, policy instruments and public acceptance; and international politics and CCS in developing countries.

However only four governments have had the courage to provide actual or allocated commercial funding to enable the first integrated projects to occur. The UK has experimented with several proposed funding mechanisms, and with several proposed designs for full-scale projects. However perceived expense remains a persistent blockage from the government perspective. And from the company perspective, perceived risk remains the critical disincentive. The UK has abundant storage which is ready to develop. CCS on gas (or maybe coal) fuelled plant is seen as the ideal compliment to variable wind power, and so is critical to the UK's future electricity delivery planning. What many analysts miss is that CO2 storage will also be vital to any negative emissions strategy either co-firing with biomass, or direct capture form the air both need to bury CO2.

This calls for further studies to learn and share experiences for developing countries. In order to fill in such a research gap, this special issue focuses on examining the recent trend of industrial emissions in developing countries. Among the manuscripts submitted to the Special Issue, twelve papers have been accepted after review, covering assessment indicators, tools and methods, and policies. Key industrial sectors, including cement, lime, aluminum, coal, mining, glass, soda ash, etc, have been investigated. Valuable policy insights have been raised, including wide scale upgrading, replacement and deployment of best available technologies, integrated information platforms, cross-cutting technologies and measures, a shift to low carbon electricity, radical product innovations, carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS), demand on new and replacement products, systematic approaches and collaboration among different industries. These useful suggestions could be shared or learned by industrial policy makers or managers in the developing world so that the overall GHG emissions from their industrial sectors can be mitigated by considering the local realities.

Carbon Policy, and Environmental Injustice","Carbon policy is a fascinating topic in geography and political ecology, because carbon is a new exchangeable good, which links the local to the international arenas through a complex set of instruments, norms, and institutions. In this paper, after explaining my theoretical and conceptual framework rooted in Africanist geography and currents of political ecology, I analyze the responses of local actors (knowledge, practices, logic, and strategies) to environmental policies and consider the effects of new mechanisms, upon local dynamics in Africa. I focus my attention on the impacts of mangrove reforestation policies on women, who harvest shellfish. My research, conducted over 35 years on coastal mangroves in Africa and Madagascar, provides me with examples. Through a long-term approach to the perception of mangroves and the changing modes of policies, I highlight the weight of imperialism and neo-liberalism and analyze types of environmental injustice against mangrove harvesters, particularly the women, who are the most directly concerned by the preservation of their heritage and are rarely recognized as stakeholders in environmental policies that are defined internationally and implemented at national and local levels. They are not informed (or are deliberately kept unware) of new devices such as REDD+. They have lost their rights of access to the reforested mangrove areas. Carbon policy requires comparative and empirical research, giving voice to local actors, especially women, about their perceptions of policies and actions.

Scientific, technical and economic dimensions","The ACCSEPT project, which ran from January 2006 to December 2007, identified and analysed the main factors which have been influencing the emergence of CO2 capture and geological storage (CCS) within the European Union (EU). The key clusters of factors concern science and technology, law and regulation, economics, and social acceptance. These factors have been analysed through interviews, a large-scale questionnaire conducted in 2006, and discussions in two stakeholder workshops (2006 and 2007). In Part I of this paper, we aim to distil the key messages and findings with regards to scientific, technical, legal and economic issues. There are no compelling scientific, technical, legal, or economic reasons why CCS could not be widely deployed in the forthcoming decades as part of a package of climate change mitigation options. In order to facilitate this deployment, governments at both the EU and Member State levels have an important role to play, in particular in establishing a robust and transparent legal framework (e.g. governing longterm environmental liability) and a strong policy framework providing sufficient and longterm incentives for CCS and CO2 transportation networks.

1664693,Too Early or Too Late for CCS - What Needs to be Done to Overcome the Valley of Death for Carbon Capture and Storage in Europe?,"Climate change has been identified as a key challenge for our modern society. Economic growth and societal welfare has always been associated with increasing energy consumption and environmental pollution. However, the key question to be answered is how much of our money we would like to invest in a better environment. The most cost-effective solution to combat climate change would be to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases where this could be done at lowest cost. However there is no real driver to reduce emissions for an individual, unless there is a legal requirement or a cost associated to the release of CO2. Neither option will work if it is applied only at national or regional scale. At a European and Member State level, numerous policies are in place designed to incentivise carbon reductions to facilitate the introduction of low carbon technologies such as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). In Europe, the financial support for (ITS demonstration via the EEPR and the NER-300 initiatives gave an expectation of the construction of 10-12 demonstration plants in Europe. The hope that these projects can be successfully deployed has been significantly declining in line with falling CO2 certificate prices. Near term stalling of CCS deployment in Europe, including technology readiness (e.g. up-scaling, by-products, emissions, aquifer storage); economics (CAPEX, OPEX), liabilities (e.g. probability, Value, guarantees); and public and political acceptance is a. likely future development. Different support mechanisms need to be applied for technology development, technology introduction and technology deployment, taking into account local conditions and interactions between different instruments. In particular all measures for technology deployment should enable a level playing field for CCS and other carbon reduction options. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

380889,Assessing the effectiveness of community-promoted environmental protection policy by using a Delphi-fuzzy method: A case study on solar power and plain afforestation in Taiwan,"Taiwan is a nation densely concentrated with industrial properties, causing a high level of greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, poor air quality and environmental pollution in Taiwan are severe societal problems. Although Taiwan has formulated severe environmental protection-related penalties, the excessive use of energy and high level of pollution remain a persisting environmental problem in Taiwan. Because communities are collective groups beneficial for the promotion of local policies, several subsidy policies for environmental quality improvement are currently promoted through community development in Taiwan. These policies consider factors such as Taiwan's long-day geographical environment and the increase in idle agricultural land after the process of economic transition. To explore the effectiveness of promoting these policies, this study applied the Delphi method and fuzzy logic theory to establish a quantified effectiveness assessment model. In addition, we determined that communities that encourage the participation of its residents and factors such as proenvironment, solar power, and plain afforestation enhanced the overall environmental protection of the community and reduced the emission of CO2. Furthermore, the core problems that hinder the improvement of current policies were identified. (C) 2015 The Authors.

1800609,The political economy of technical fixes: The (mis)alignment of clean fossil and political regimes,"This paper argues that existing critiques of technical fixes are unable to explain our simultaneous enamourment and distrust with technical fixes, and that to do so, we need a political economy analysis. We develop a critical, theoretically grounded conceptualisation of technical fixes as imagined defensive spatio-temporal fixes of specific political economic regimes, and apply it to the case of geoengineering, or 'clean fossil', as an attempted technical fix of the climate change problem. We map the promises of clean fossil as a proposed solution to the problem of climate change in discrete episodes since the 1960s. The paper shows that clean fossil promises have been surprisingly poorly aligned with the neoliberal regime, and explains how they have been moderately stable due to those misalignments. We also show that different liberal capitalisms could be supported by different clean fossil technologies, but also that illiberal or more egalitarian regimes remain possible alongside particular, perhaps radically re-envisioned, versions of clean fossil. Ambivalence towards clean fossil technical fix promises is intelligible, given the inherent instability of their co-evolution with neoliberalism and future political regimes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

373897,The growth of political support for CO2 capture and storage in Norway,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has enjoyed stronger political support in Norway than in other countries. Early CCS initiatives were motivated by the challenge of reconciling relatively ambitious climate policy targets with growing emissions from Norway's offshore oil and gas operations, whose expertise and project opportunities formed the basis for these initiatives. The early start of the CCS debate created political path dependence effects, including recruitment of much of the environmental sector (government agencies and some NGOs) as CCS promoters. Paradoxically, the historical absence from Norway of fossil-based power generation also favoured CCS. Initiatives to add gas-fired generating capacity to Norway's previously emissions-free power supply created an entrenched conflict in which CCS became a politically necessary compromise. The more recent growth in political support for CCS in other countries may be explained by the fact that governments increasingly experience similar, politically difficult climate/energy policy dilemmas.",climate policy; CCS; technology; policy entrepreneurship; path dependence,Article,2011.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8050044775009155,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

1563365,Mapping the necessary policy instruments to unlock the potentials of private finance for carbon capture and storage technologies,"The Paris Agreement adopted at COP21 states that it is necessary to reduce 55 GtCO 2 -eq that is anticipated in 2030 to 40 GtCO 2 -eq in order to keep the global average temperature rise within 2 °C based on before industrialization. Moreover, we should peak out GHG emissions worldwide as quickly as possible, and should aim to achieve a well-balanced artificial discharge and absorption in the second half of the century. Estimates under diverse assumptions suggest that the total global emissions should be 55 GtCO 2 -eq in 2025 and 56.2 GtCO 2 -eq in 2030. However, this is insufficient for achieving the second goal (56.2 GtCO 2 -eq). Improvement pressure on high emission countries such as Japan tends to increase in the process where improvement of Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) is required at the stocktaking meeting of United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In the future, important factors for promoting global warming countermeasures are investment not only from public sector but also private sector for emission reduction measures and cost burden method associated with carbon emissions. Although Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is attracting attention, as one of the technologies that can contribute to achieving the climate goal, the investment cost is high and its development is difficult. The major reasons for the difficulty of deployment are not only the cost but also the impacts derived from deployment of the CCS technologies (CCSTs). In order to develop and expand CCSTs as a promising solution towards low-carbon development, it is essential to improve the social and economic environment such as institutional and funding mechanisms that support development of CCS projects. Since CCS technologies are expensive, in addition to CCTs, it is desirable to develop financial support schemes. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.",,Book Chapter,2018.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.8026356101036072,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
786553,Climate policies and nationally determined contributions: reconciling the needed ambition with the political economy,"Countries have pledged to stabilize global warming at a 1.5-2 degrees C increase. Either target requires reaching net zero emissions before the end of the century, which implies a major transformation of the economic system. This study reviews the literature on how policymakers can design climate policies and their nationally determined contributions to reach zero-net emissions before the end of the century in a socially and politically acceptable manner. To get the ambition right, policymakers can use sectoral roadmaps with targets and indicators that track progress toward zero emissions (e.g., regarding renewable power or reforestation). Indeed, monitoring economy-wide emissions-reductions alone would not ensure that short-term action contributes meaningfully to the long-term decarbonization goal. To get the political economy right, climate policies can be designed so that they contribute to nonclimate objectives and create broad coalitions of supporters. For instance, carbon taxes revenues can fund social assistance and infrastructure investment, while reducing tax evasion and informality. To minimize social and economic disruptions and avoid stranded assets, policymakers can also start with a low carbon price level and use complementary policies. Designed at the sector level, complementary policies such as performance standards or feebates for cars, building norms, or moratoriums on new coal power plants can be negotiated in partnership with local stakeholders and trigger a transition to zero carbon that does not directly affect existing polluting capital.

2689828,A Review on Public Understanding of Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) in South Korea,"Since the Paris Agreement, member countries have set national goals clearly stated in the ""Intended Nationally Determined Contributions"" (INDC) to reduce the intended amount of carbon dioxide. In many other countries, the government has invested in national R&D to promote cleaner energy and Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) projects that is considered as one of the most pragmatic means to achieve the set mitigation target in a national scale. In some country, the control and management of CO2 has been implemented in new technical systems called CO2 smart grids. However, along with continual CCS R&D, laws and regulatory interventions supporting its technical pillars should mutually encompass its development. Without public understanding, technological development cannot be fully implemented by the involved public and private entities permitting to attain the set mitigation targets. In previous research, only few studies on public understanding have linked its policies to the actual valid legislation. This article therefore aims to review the overall public understanding conditions on CCS in Korea and to systematically outline public understanding in actual Acts as well as in the Draft of Korean integrated CCS Act.

5196084,What is the future potential of CCS in Brazil? An expert elicitation study on the role of CCS in the country,"This article presents the results of an expert elicitation about the role of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in Brazil as a measure to reduce greenhouse gases emissions, its costs, and the most appropriate policies to develop this technology at a commercial scale. Experts were elicited based on a scenario oriented towards net-zero emissions in Brazil by 2050. Five parameters were elicited, and all present great uncertainty. Results show that experts believe CCS has the potential to reduce CO2 emissions in Brazil. Still, with the current lack of supporting market, policy and regulatory frameworks in place, it could take another five years to begin implementation, reaching commercial scale not earlier than 12 years from the time of writing. Experts say that the chance of Brazil reaching the elicited value of 190 million tons of CO2 per year is very low. This indicates that though CCS can play a role in achieving net-zero emissions in the country, many other measures will be necessary. Policy-wise, the experts bet on a carbon market as the most probable policy instrument to help CCS development in Brazil. The experts also estimated the total investment necessary to reach 190 million tons of CO2 per year captured at USD 58 billion. When it comes to public expenditures, experts believe the role of the government in funding CCS in the country would be approximately 25% of total investments coming from different sources of public investment.",Carbon Capture and Storage; Net-zero emissions; Expert elicitation; public policies; Brazil,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.8012012839317322,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

STATA 17 was used for the analysis. The results confirm the hypothesis that countries with high fossil fuel consumption and oil reserves are investing in blue hydrogen and CCS towards a ""zero-carbon-emission"" perspective.

A UK CASE STUDY,"Anticipatory adaptation to climate change requires the impact of future changes in water availability to be investigated prior to deployment of low-carbon electricity generation infrastructure. Here we investigate whether climate change may limit water availability for a proposed coal-fired (CF) power station site with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). We find that climate change may pose constraints on water availability, and that regulatory constraints on water abstraction licences may affect CF electricity generation with CCS. The regulatory constraints associated with the current misalignment of water and energy policies are explored through interviews with stakeholders. We find that water availability has not been identified as a potential limiting factor for future CF electricity generation with CCS and that current UK energy policy, combined with economic and historical factors, may exacerbate the water demand of CF electricity generation with CCS.

1867593,Financing early opportunity CCS projects in emerging economies through the carbon market: mitigation potential and costs,"The Kyoto Protocol's flexible mechanisms allow projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions to generate 'carbon credits'. The most well known of the schemes is the clean development mechanism (CDM), which applies to emission reduction projects in developing and emerging economy countries that have ratified the Kyoto Protocol. The eligibility of carbon dioxide (CO2) capture and storage (CCS) technologies within the CDM has been a protracted process. One of the concerns hampering progress relates to the possible market implications of inclusion because of the potentially very large number of certified emission reduction units (CERs) that could be generated from CCS projects, which could potentially destabilize the global carbon market, for example, by depressing global carbon prices due to over-supply relative to demand. Drawing on these concerns, this paper provides a summary of analysis undertaken to assess the potential scale of such effects in both 2012 (the end of first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) and in 2020, with a view to evaluating the legitimacy of concerns in the short- to medium-term. It also provides some views on the potential alternative mechanisms that could evolve post-2012 for incentivizing and financing investments made in CCS technologies in developing and emerging economies.

220652,The Canadian oil sands industry under carbon constraints,"We investigate the impact of climate policies on Canada's oil sands industry, the largest of its kind in the world. Deriving petroleum products such as gasoline and diesel from oils sands involves significant amounts of energy, and that contributes to a high level of CO2 emissions. We apply the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, a computable general equilibrium model of the world economy, augmented to include detail on the oil sands production processes, including the possibility of carbon capture and storage (CCS). We find: (1) without climate policy, annual Canadian bitumen production increases almost 4-fold from 2010 to 2050; (2) with climate policies implemented in developed countries, Canadian bitumen production drops by 32% to 68% from the reference 4-fold increase, depending on the viability of large-scale CCS implementation, and bitumen upgrading capacity moves to the developing countries; (3) with climate policies implemented worldwide, the Canadian bitumen production is significantly reduced even with CCS technology, which lowers CO2 emissions at an added cost. This is mainly because upgrading bitumen abroad is no longer economic with the global climate policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) allows for the joint implementation (JI) of measures to mitigate the emissions of greenhouse gases. The concept of JI refers to the implementation of such measures in one country with partial or full financial and/or technical support from another country, potentially fulfilling some of the supporting country's emission-reduction commitment under the FCCC. At present, all JI transactions are voluntary, and no country has claimed JI credit against existing FCCC commitments. Nevertheless, JI could have important implications for both the economic efficiency and the international equity of the implementation of the FCCC. This paper discusses some of the information needs of JI projects and seeks to clarify some of the common assumptions and arguments about JI. Issues regarding JI are distinguished according to those that are specific to JI and those that apply to JI as well as other types of regimes and transactions. The focus is on the position of developing countries and their potential risks and benefits regarding JI. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,Article,1997.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7992601990699768,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The Court upheld the judgment in first instance issuing injunctive relief to the effect that the Dutch State has to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2020 by 25 per cent compared with 1990. Unlike the Court of first instance, the Court of Appeal relies on human rights law, in particular the right to life and family life. As a whole, the judgment is appealing and the legal basis is sound. This note discusses the key features of the judgment: the political question, human rights law and the reduction obligation of 25 per cent, the State's defence that it may choose between adaptation and mitigation, minimal causation, and carbon capture and storage.

5343937,Governing Open Ocean and Fish Carbon: Perspectives and Opportunities,"Marine life plays a vital role in the ocean’s biological pump by sequestering and mediating fluxes of carbon to the deep sea and sea floor. The roles that fish and other marine vertebrates play in the biological pump are increasingly attracting scientific and policy attention. In this paper, we investigated the interest in and possibilities for the international governance of open ocean and fish carbon ecosystem services. We used semi-structured interviews with representatives from environmental non-governmental organisations (ENGOs), policy makers, and policy experts, along with an exploratory review of grey and peer-reviewed literature to: 1) trace the pathway of important milestones, key actors, and their strategies to influence governance of ocean carbon, and, 2) investigate which frameworks might be used to govern open ocean and fish carbon. Strategies of key actors to direct attention to open ocean and fish carbon included collaborating with scientists, organising side events at climate and biodiversity negotiations and seminars to engage policy makers, as well as educational campaigns directed to the public and policy makers about the co-benefits of open ocean and fish carbon. While we found a strong focus of ENGO activities related to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, we also found strong opposition against active governance of open ocean and fish carbon by key Intergovernmental actors in this forum. Opposition stems from a lack of scientific information on how long open ocean and fish carbon is stored, difficulties in attributing carbon flows with individual countries mitigation actions, and fewer perceived co-benefits (e.g. coastal protection in the case of coastal blue carbon) for coastal communities. More viable routes for the future governance of open ocean and fish carbon may lie in international fisheries management and in current negotiations of a treaty for biodiversity conservation in the high seas.

We develop an economic model characterizing the production decisions in animal and crop production farms and link our discussion on policy instruments to them. We review mitigation measures and their cost-effectiveness in reducing emissions. Given the multiple sources of agricultural emissions, the literature finds carbon taxes and emissions trading to perform best. The challenges involved in measuring and verifying changes in emissions make the implementation of policies targeting all sources of emissions difficult. Second-best policies addressing a subset of emissions, such as those from ruminants or mineral fertilizers, are more feasible but less efficient.

Watershed residents helped develop four scenarios to evaluate alternative future trends in agricultural management and to project potential economic and environmental outcomes. We found that environmental and economic benefits can be attained through changes in agricultural land management without increasing public costs. The magnitude of these benefits depends on the magnitude of changes to agricultural practices. Environmental benefits include improved water quality, healthier fish, increased carbon sequestration, and decreased greenhouse gas emissions, while economic benefits include social capital formation, greater farm profitability; and avoided costs.

A top-down energy-economy model is used that has three emission reduction options: energy savings, a transition towards less-carbon-intensive or non-carbon energy resources, and the use of carbon dioxide capture and storage technology. Five policy instruments - carbon taxes, fossil fuel taxes, non-carbon (renewable) energy subsidies, a portfolio standard for the carbon intensity of energy production, and a portfolio standard for the use of non-carbon (renewable) energy resources - are compared in terms of costs, efficiency and their impact on the composition of the energy supply system. One of our main conclusions is that a carbon intensity portfolio standard, involving the recycling of carbon taxes to support renewables deployment, is the most cost-efficient way to address the problem of global climate change.

Critics argue that 'negative emission technologies' (NETs) are insufficiently mature to rely on them for climate stabilization. Some even argue that 2 degrees C is no longer feasible or might have unacceptable social and environmental costs. Nonetheless, the Paris Agreement endorsed an aspirational goal of limiting global warming to even lower levels, arguing that climate impacts-especially for vulnerable nations such as small island states-will be unacceptably severe in a 2 degrees C world. While there are few pathways to 2 degrees C that do not rely on negative emissions, 1.5 degrees C scenarios are barely conceivable without them.

This paper analyses the trajectory of Cambodia's first large-scale reforestation project awarded within the context of climate change mitigation. The 34,007 ha concession was formally conceived to promote sustainable resource use, livelihood improvements and emission reduction. On the ground, however, vast tracks of diverse forest landscapes are being cleared and converted to acacia monocultures, existing timber stocks are logged for market sale, and customary land users dispossessed from land and forest resources. While the project adds to an ongoing land grab crisis in Cambodia, we argue that the explicit environmental ends of the forestry concession enabled a 'green grab' that not only exceeds the scale of land grabs caused by conventional economic land concessions, but surprisingly also exacerbates forest logging and biodiversity loss in the area. This case demonstrates the extent to which current climate change discourses, forestry agendas and their underlying assumptions require critical revision in global policy discussions to forestall the growing problem of green grabbing in land use.",Cambodia; Prey Long forest; Green grabbing; Shifting cultivation; Climate change mitigation; Forest definition,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7949057221412659,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
51981,Carbon Trade-Offs Along Tropical Forest Margins: Lessons from ASB Partnership work in Cameroon,"Changes in forest and tree cover can lead to rapid and substantial carbon emissions. Currently, about 7.3 million ha of forests are lost annually, releasing an estimated 5.8 gigatons of carbon dioxide (Gt CO2) per year into the atmosphere. This represents 12-17% of human-generated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. On the other hand, forests have the capacity to act as sinks (the ability to absorb and hold CO2 for long periods). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Third Assessment report puts the total potential for avoiding carbon emissions through aggressive forestry practice changes on 700 million ha of forest at about 60-80 billion tons, or about 12-25% of current fossil fuel emissions over a period of 50 years. As a corollary, forests and trees have been at the heart of strategies and negotiations for mitigating GHG emissions in the last few years. The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) are two key policy instruments that have emerged in the last few years to enable climate change mitigation through forests and trees. The CDM is a mechanism employed within the context of the Kyoto protocol to enable carbon sequestration through afforestation and reforestation (A/R), but has had little success so far in developing countries (Boyd et al. 2009). Meanwhile agreement was reached on the key principles for a REDD+ mechanism at the 16th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Cancún. The REDD+ idea suggests a mechanism in which countries that reduce national level deforestation to below an agreed level would receive compensation or rewards. These countries may also make commitments to stabilize or further reduce deforestation in the future. Such reductions can be obtained through “reducing emissions from deforestation, "" “reducing emissions from forest degradation, "" “conservation of forest carbon stocks, "" “sustainable management of forests, "" and “enhancement of carbon stocks.” The reductions and rewards must contribute to sustainable development. The level of sustainable development benefits, costs and trade-offs to be expected from a REDD+ type of scheme remains a fundamental question, as very little evidence currently exists, but expectations of win-win situations are high. At what point, or when, will carbon represent a good proposition to land users seeking to put land into alternative livelihoods and biodiversity conservation uses? This chapter examines the trade-offs between carbon and alternative land uses in the southern forest zone of Cameroon. It uses evidence from long-term research by the Alternatives to Slash-and-Burn (ASB) Partnership for the Tropical Forest Margins (see also chapter by Gockowski and Van Asten). In line with current global forest and tree climate mitigation strategies, the ASB Partnership is conducting research on how to reduce deforestation along tropical forest margins without compromising agricultural productivity and the provision of environmental services. ASB was created in 1994 as a partnership between international and national research organizations and universities, and is currently working in a network of sites across the humid and sub-humid tropics. ASB research primarily focuses on the sustainability of impacts in terms of livelihoods, agricultural productivity, environmental services, and the trade-offs therein. Uniform indicators, methods and approaches have been applied to understand land use, carbon, biodiversity, agricultural productivity and livelihood impacts across more than 12 sites (Palm et al. 2005). This chapter focuses on trade-offs between carbon, profitability and biodiversity in order to provide insights into the potential for REDD+ and other mechanisms to meet the triple objectives of climate, development and conservation using Cameroon as an example. © 2012 ICRAF and CIAT, for the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security.",,Book Chapter,2013.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7948217391967773,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

International Energy Agency's (IEA) electricity demand of 30 000 TWh by 2030 can be met with 10 000 TWh each from renewable, nuclear and fossil fuel energy. However, the ill-imposed very strict control of tiny public exposure to ionising radiation from nuclear energy continues to pose a serious hindrance. Effort needs to be rebalanced to produce an even-handed control of public exposure with emphasis on the most significant sources (i.e. natural background radiation and medical use) and vice versa. The on-going revision of the International Atomic Energy Agency Basic Safety Standards (BSS) provides an opportunity to achieve this internationally so that national regulations can be subsequently remediated.

1563726,Climate change: Back to development,"The Paris Agreement has created a double bifurcation. First, from top-down approach (with an emissions limit imposed from above) to a bottom-up approach based on national emissions reduction pledges. And second, from a mitigation-centered policy to a more balanced mitigation and adaptation efforts. The following work proposes, however, that further steps must be taken to bring the theme of development back to the center of the fight against climate change. The article is divided into four parts. First is a reflection on the fact that mitigation has captured much of the attention during the past twenty years, but that adaptation is progressively gaining importance in policies to combat climate change. The next section explains why, starting from the Framework Convention on Climate Change in 1992, the objective of the “stabilization of greenhouse gases concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system” has led first to define the increase of 2 ° C as the limit not to be exceeded, then to the search for an equivalent level of CO2 concentration and last to the related carbon budget. The third part shows why the goal of not exceeding the 2 ° C temperature increase is illusory when considering the discrepancy between actual mitigation policies and theoretical commitments required based on the data presented by the IPCC. Even salvation coming from negative emission technologies at the moment seems more theoretical than real. The final conclusions state that, given the insufficiency of the mitigation tools, adaptation must be taken seriously – not as a passive solution, but as a conception of a different kind of development, which is required not only to fight climate change, but also for other purposes. © FrancoAngeli.",Adaptation; Climate change; Mitigation; Paris agreement; Sustainable development,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7941425442695618,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
382056,Economic and Time-Sensitive Issues Surrounding CCS: A Policy Analysis,"Are the existing global policies on combating global warming via the carbon capture and storage (CCs) method significant enough to curtail the temperature rise on time? We argue that it is already too late to have any reliance on CCS. The current status of CCS is that it is plagued by technical uncertainties, infrastructure, financial, and regulatory issues. The technology is far from maturity and, hence, commercialization. Simulations conducted in this work suggest that the relevance of CCS is completely defied if the annual emission growth rate is in excess of 2% between the years of 2015 and 2040. At such a growth rate, the annual emissions reduction between 2040 and 2100 will need to be in the vicinity of 5.5% by the year 2100. Considering an average annual emissions growth rate of 2.5% over the past decade, it 2015 seems unlikely that the emissions could be contained to a 2% growth level. CCS in its current shape and form is at odds with the economics of its implementation and the time in hand with which to play a significant role in a carbon mitigation strategy.

244639,Political legitimacy in decisions about experiments in solar radiation management,"Introduction. For better or for worse, geoengineering has moved from the fringes of the climate change debate to the halls of Capitol Hill and Westminster. Of course, a great deal of research remains to be done before the world decides whether to introduce geoengineering as a complement to mitigation and adaptation; academics and policy makers are still wrestling with the scientific, political, legal, social, and ethical questions surrounding the intentional modification of the climate. Here we address the institutional aspects of some of the ethical issues raised by research on geoengineering. The most ethically challenging form of geoengineering research involves solar radiation management (SRM), which attempts to reduce the earth’s absorption of incoming solar radiation. One proposed mechanism for SRM is the injection of aerosols into the stratosphere, which would deflect more solar radiation back into space. In contrast to research into carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which is the other main category of proposed geoengineering activities, SRM research is particularly challenging ethically because studying and testing SRM technologies can require deployment at scales that could have significant regional or global climatic effects. For instance, testing the effects of stratospheric aerosol injection would require lofting enough aerosols into the atmosphere, over a long enough period of time, to distinguish the effect of the aerosols from normal climatic variation. The consequences of such large-scale testing could cause serious harm to millions of people. For instance, SRM could change regional precipitation patterns, threatening water supplies and agriculture. Moreover, whereas CDR aims to return the atmosphere to an earlier, familiar state, SRM aims to create a new state – one of high greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and reduced insolation – about which we know much less. © Cambridge University Press 2013.",,Book Chapter,2010.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.793379008769989,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
728371,The political economy of technical fixes: A case from the climate domain,"This paper argues that existing critiques of technical fixes are unable to explain our simultaneous enamourment and distrust with technical fixes, and that to do so, we need a political economy analysis. We develop a critical, theoretically grounded conceptualisation of technical fixes as imagined defensive spatio-temporal fixes of specific political economic regimes, and apply it to the case of geoengineering, or ‘clean fossil’, as an attempted technical fix of the climate change problem. We map the promises of clean fossil as proposed solutions to the problem of climate change in discrete episodes since the 1960s. The paper shows that clean fossil promises have been surprisingly poorly aligned with the neoliberal regime, and explains how they have been moderately stable due to those misalignments. We also show that different liberal capitalisms could be supported by different clean fossil technologies, but also that illiberal or more egalitarian regimes remain possible alongside particular, perhaps radically re-envisioned, versions of clean fossil. Ambivalence towards clean fossil technical fix promises is intelligible, given the inherent instability of their co-evolution with neoliberalism and future political regimes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7929217219352722,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

5336675,Casting a Wider Net on Ocean NETs,"Societal issues involving policies and publics are generally understudied in research on ocean-based Negative Emission Technologies (NETs), yet will be crucial if novel techniques are ever to function at scale. Public attitudes are vital for emerging technologies: publics influence political mandates, help determine the degree of uptake by market actors, and are key to realizing broader ambitions for robust decision-making and responsible incentivization. Discourses surrounding ocean NETs will also have fundamental effects on how governance for the techniques emerges, shaping how they are defined as an object of governance, who is assigned the authority to govern, and what instruments are deemed appropriate. This Perspective brings together key insights on the societal dimensions of ocean NETs, drawing on existing work on public acceptability, policy assessment, governance, and discourse. Ocean iron fertilization is the only ocean NET on which there exists considerable social science research thus far, and we show that much evidence points against its social desirability. Taken in conjunction with considerable natural science uncertainties, this leads us to question whether further research is actually necessary in order to rule out ocean iron fertilization as an option. For other ocean NETs, there is a need for further research into social dimensions, yet research on analogous technologies shows that ocean interventions will likely evoke strong risk perceptions, and evidence suggests that the majority of ocean NETs may face a greater public acceptability challenge than terrestrial NETs. Ocean NETs also raise complex challenges around governance, which pose questions well-beyond the remit of the natural sciences and engineering. Using a conceptual exploration of the ways in which different types of discourse may shape emerging ocean NETs governance, we show that the very idea of ocean NETs is likely to set the stage for a whole new range of contested futures.

728950,Biochar: An emerging policy arrangement in Brazil?,"Biochar, the solid product of pyrolysis, has emerged as a new technology and policy tool to address various environmental challenges (climate change, food production and agricultural waste management). The concept of biochar drew its inspiration from Amazonian practices that had led to the creation of Amazonian Dark Earth (ADE): fertile soils rich in (bio)char and human artefacts. In this article, we conceptualize biochar as an emerging policy arrangement, and examine it along the four dimensions of the Policy Arrangement Approach (FAA), which are actors, discourse, power and rules. We focus on Brazil as an important player in the international biochar debate. Our analysis shows that science experts are the predominant players in the network, while policy-makers, businessmen and farmers are marginally positioned. Experts from Embrapa occupy central positions and thus exercise most power in the network. Moreover, experts linked to ADE have lost prominence in the network. The reason for this is to be found in the shift from the ADE/ biochar to the biochar/technology discourse. The latter discourse includes different coalitions such as 'climate change mitigation', the 'improvement of soil fertility' and 'improving crop residue management'. Although the biochar/climate coalition is dominant at the international level, it is far less prominent in Brazil. Nationally, it is particularly the discourses of 'improvement of soil fertility' and 'improving crop residue management' which have prompted actors' relationships and practices. However, the biochar/technology discourse has not (yet) been formally institutionalized in Brazil. As a consequence, the country lacks an established biochar policy field. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

540464,Separating the debate on CO2 utilisation from carbon capture and storage,"To address the urging challenge of climate change, the concept of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) plays a key role for keeping global warming below 2 degrees C. Recently, the concept of Carbon Capture and Utilisation (CCU) has been a focus of growing attention with the aim of enabling an industrial utilisation of CO2 as feedstock in the production of materials and fuels. Also in the pursuit of the ambitious targets set by the COP21 Paris agreement, CCU technologies could be discussed as an increasingly relevant means to meet mitigation targets. Often, CCU is commingled with the more prominent CCS and evaluated from the same peripective of climate change mitigation potential. Sometimes, the idea of utilising CO2 as a resource is even used as an argument for investments in CCS. Despite some technological similarities, however, CCU and CCS address significantly different issues within the environmental policy debate. This paper analyses the commonalities and differences between CCU and CCS and recommends how one should be distinguished from the other, particularly in environmental policy fields and the public debate. Particularly, hopes that CCU could represent a promising perspective for contributing to mitigation efforts should not be exaggerated and considerations of CCU in climate politics need to account for the largely varying and technology specific temporary storage times of CO2 and its specific substitution potential. Consequently, we call for accounting mechanisms and legislations for CCU that acknowledge the different storage durations and efficiency gains of CCU technologies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Our response to this threat will irrevocably transform the energy sector and the priorities within it. The trend in emissions over the next decade will largely determine whether the process of climate change can be kept at a moderate level. This literature-based study focuses on Finland as an example case. Oil price fluctuations, economic development and changes in consumer values and attitudes are key forces that will drive change in the energy sector. A greater diversity of energy sources is vital if we are to avoid a catastrophic warming of the climate. The use of renewable energy sources must be increased, and the efficiency of producing, transmitting and distributing energy must be improved. The energy sector must also exploit the potential of nuclear energy, wind, solar and hydro power, afforestation measures, biomass resources, carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology and the nano-bio sector. National policies and measures must be set out in detail and global cooperation enhanced. The presence and impact of factors that impede the work to curb climate change must also be taken into account in energy strategies if these strategies are to be successful. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Integrating Ecosystem Services into Regional Policy Planning in the Three Gorges Reservoir Area of China,"Land use/Land cover (LULC) changes as a result of policy planning influence ecosystem structures, processes, and functions, which are the basis for providing a wide range of ecosystem services (ES). There is an increasing consensus about the importance of integrating ES into ecological policy but quantifying the potential impacts of different policy on ES has proven difficult. We designed a remote sensing, geographic information system and scenario analysis-based approach to estimate and analyze the relationship between ES (soil conservation and carbon sequestration) and ecological policy designed to improve human welfare in the Chongqing municipality in the upper reaches of the Three Gorges Reservoir Area, China; a densely populated, highly modified watershed with serious soil erosion and flood hazard. Three alternative scenarios in 2050 were modeled for the Three Gorges Reservoir Area watershed. The model GEOMOD was used to predict future LULC changes due to policy planning. The ES models (Universal Soil Loss Equation model and Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach model) were designed to inform decisions, with an aim to align economic forces with conservation. We examine policy effectiveness by comparing scenarios for 2050 (Scenario1: Maintain current policy with no considerations of ES; Scenario2: Integrate ES into policy planning; Scenario3: Integrate ES into policy planning in view of the need of local people). Scenario-based LULC change analysis revealed that if the current afforestation policy continues (scenario 1), total ES would be further increased in 2050 due to expansion of forest cover. However, by targeting policy to improve ES provision (scenarios 2 and 3), ecological risks of soil loss can be significantly reduced and carbon sequestration enhanced. Scenario 3, thus, provided the best future environmental development scenario considering the need of local people in each region for ES. This scenario will theoretically help the Three Gorges Dam to harvest more ecological benefits through improvements in soil conservation and carbon sequestration. This study highlights the observation that including ES in policy planning and has a great potential to generate opportunities to maximize ES.

But deforestation is also occurring in the temperate and boreal forests. It proceeds in the United States in response to economic pressures and political weakness, even corruption. The re-establishment of forests has the potential for contributing to the stabilization of the composition of the atmosphere by removing carbon as carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it on land for an indefinite period. Global interests in management of forests introduce a new element into international relations.

703247,Positioning Nuclear Power in the Low-Carbon Electricity Transition,"Addressing climate change requires de-carbonizing future energy supplies in an increasingly energy-dependent world. The IEA and the IPCC (2014) mention the following as low-carbon energy supply options: 'renewable energy, nuclear power and fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage'. Positioning nuclear power in the decarbonization transition is a problematic issue and is overridden by ill-conceived axioms. Before probing these axioms, we provide an overview of five major, postwar energy-related legacies and some insight into who is engaged in nuclear activities. We check whether low-carbon nuclear power passes the full sustainability test and whether it is compatible with the unfettered deployment of variable renewable power sourced from the sun and from wind and water currents, which delivers two negative answers. We show that the best approach of the sustainable energy transition was Germany's 2011 decision to phase out nuclear power for a fast development and full deployment of renewable power. This is the best approach for the sustainable energy transition. We offer five practical suggestions to strengthen and accelerate carbon-and nuclear-free transitions. They are related to institutional issues like the role of cost-benefit analysis and the mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency, to the costs of nuclear risks and catastrophes, and to the historical record of nuclear technology and business.",nuclear power; nuclear risks; sustainability; low-carbon transition; electricity sector; renewable energy; IAEA International Atomic Energy Agency; IPCC Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7886072993278503,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Carbon sequestered in soils also provides a further regulating ecosystem service, valued as the avoided damage from global climate change. We consider the demand and supply attributes that underpin and constrain the emergence of a market value for this vital global ecosystem service: markets being what economists regard as the most efficient institutions for allocating scarce resources to the supply and consumption of valuable goods. This paper considers how a potentially large global supply of soil carbon sequestration is reduced by economic and behavioural constraints that impinge on the emergence of markets, and alternative public policies that can efficiently transact demand for the service from private and public sector agents. In essence, this is a case of significant market failure. In the design of alternative policy options, we consider whether soil carbon mitigation is actually cost-effective relative to other measures in agriculture and elsewhere in the economy, and the nature of behavioural incentives that hinder policy options. We suggest that reducing the cost and uncertainties of mitigation through soil-based measures is crucial for improving uptake.

As part of a broader attempt to identify the complex interactions between water resource policies and CCS, an analysis was undertaken at both the state and the federal level to scope the policy environments surrounding extracted water policies and laws. Six states (California, Illinois, Mississippi, Montana, North Dakota, and Texas) were chosen for this analysis because either active CCS work is currently underway, or the potential exists for future work. Although regulation of extracted waters could potentially occur at many points along the CCS life cycle, this paper focuses on regulation that may apply when the water is with drawn that is, accessed and removed from the saline aquifer-and when it is re-injected in a close but unconnected aquifer. It was found that no regulations exist for this source specifically. In addition, greater input is needed from regulators and policy makers in terms of defining this resource. In particular, regulation of extracted waters (and CCS activities broadly) often overlaps with the management of fluids produced during oil and gas development. Many regulations would apply to extracted waters if they were classified as such. Therefore, correct categorization is key as the industry in this space continues to grow. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

492388,INTEGRATING CLIMATIC-CHANGE AND FORESTS - ECONOMIC AND ECOLOGIC ASSESSMENTS,"Effective policies for dealing with anticipated climatic changes must reflect the two-way interactions between climate, forests and society. Considerable analysis has focused on one aspect of forests - timber production - at a local and regional scale, but no fully integrated global studies have been conducted. The appropriate ecological and economic models appear to be available to do so. Nontimber aspects of forests dominate the social values provided by many forests, especially remote or unmanaged lands where the impacts of climatic change are apt to be most significant. Policy questions related to these issues and lands are much less well understood. Policy options related to afforestation are well studied, but other ways the forest sector can help ameliorate climatic change merit more extensive analysis. Promising possibilities include carbon taxes to influence the management of extant forests, and materials policies to lengthen the life of wood products or to encourage the substitution of CO2-fixing wood products for ones manufactured from less benign materials.",,Article,1994.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7877415418624878,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

It synthesizes the experiences of eight participant groups who worked with four scenarios of unauthorized use of solar geoengineering. It draws both substantive insights about solar geoengineering risks and governance and methodological insights for the use of scenario exercises to explore this issue, as well as identifying major uncertainties and questions raised by the exercise. Prominent themes include the need for strategic sequencing of actions by those initiating and responding to solar geoengineering challenges; the nature and foundations of potential opposition; the widespread interest in normalizing or domesticating a disruptive intervention after the fact; the importance of embedding solar geoengineering actions in the broader context of climate policy and the difficulty of doing so given their disruptive character; and the importance and likely structure of negotiations to move from initial disruptive action, whatever its initiators and form, to expand participation and embed solar geoengineering decisions in a broadly legitimate multilateral governance structure.

4379122,Beyond the social cost of carbon: Negative emission technologies as a means for biophysically setting the price of carbon,"The social cost of carbon (SCC) is an estimate of the costs that society will incur because of the emission of one tonne of CO2. Because of the large uncertainties in the effects of climate change and the subjectivity of the discount rate, estimates of SCC range widely, from - 10.2 to 105 213$ t(-1)in 2010 USD. Despite this range, the SCC has been used or proposed as a basis for a wide variety of policymaking including cost-benefit analysis and carbon taxes. The SCC suffers from several practical and philosophical weaknesses: it is anthropocentric, it neglects the acidification of oceans, it assumes that quantifiable economic variables like GDP are the primary costs that humans will experience from climate change, and it is impossible to quantify objectively. Further, the ethical implications of a carbon pricing policy include both the value of the carbon price, and the use of revenues generated by the policy. Thus, revenue neutral carbon policies as in some SCC-based proposals, are unlikely to be just. Here, we propose that the cost of emerging negative-emission technologies would be an alternative means for setting a carbon price and avoid these philosophical and practical weaknesses.",Climate justice; Externality; Negative emission technology; Polluter pays principle; Social cost of carbon,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7870230674743652,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
4915446,Solar geoengineering: Scenarios of future governance challenges,"In the face of increasingly clear climate-change impacts and continued inadequacy of efforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and adapt to ongoing climate changes, increasing attention has been directed to geoengineering: deliberate large-scale interventions in the Earth's climate system to moderate global warming. Such interventions could reduce risks in novel ways, but are controversial because they present an uncertain, high-stakes mix of potential benefits and risks. Solar geoengineering poses especially acute international governance needs, particularly in the case of potential future demands to use it. Many aspects of geoengineering present deep, ill structured uncertainties that carry high stakes for near-term decisions, and are thus suitable for exploration through scenarios. This collection of papers reports on a major scenario exercise examining governance challenges and potential responses for solar geoengineering, held at the International Summer School on Geoengineering Governance in Banff, Canada in 2019.

Awareness creation and determined actions adhering to a rights-based framework are required to address the climate crisis. The nations have an obligation to cooperate internationally to ensure respect for human rights everywhere in the world according to the Charter of the United Nations. No short-term solutions should be promoted and adopted, like nuclear power, agro-fuels, offsetting, carbon-capture and storage (CCS), biochar, geo-engineering, and carbon trading. It is clear that solving the climate crisis requires far-reaching transformations, which are currently excluded from the agenda of policy-makers in governments and multilateral institutions.

312680,Carbon Cautious: Israel's Afforestation Experience and Approach to Sequestration,"During the past 60 years, afforestation has transformed Israel's landscape, with forests planted or planned on 10% of the country's land, much of it with less than 300 mm of annual precipitation. After early efforts to establish a successful commercial timber industry failed, recreation and ecosystem services came to dominate forestry policy objectives. Given Israel's status as a 'developing country' under the Kyoto Protocol, forests' economic potential through carbon sequestration has been explored, but has not yet proven to be compelling. Several considerations cooled initial enthusiasm for seeking international carbon credits through afforestation. These include administrative obstacles associated with international accreditation, limited potential economic profitability, and ethical considerations. Rather, a voluntary offsetting program was adopted, allowing donors to plant trees in Israel, that balance individual carbon emissions. Afforestation in drylands exhibit meaningful potential to counteract chronic carbon loss due to land degradation. As trees planted in Israel's semi-arid regions exhibit surprisingly high carbon sequestration properties that are comparable to forests in temperate Europe, the potential for offsetting may become a growing factor in local forestry policy once Israel begins to regulate CO2 emissions.",Forestry policies; Israel; Carbon; Sequestration,Article,2010.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7844473123550415,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
743665,A quantitative assessment of policy options for no net loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the European Union,"The Biodiversity Strategy of the European Union includes a target to ""ensure no-net-loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services by 2020"". Many policy options can be envisioned to achieve such a no-net-loss target, mainly acting on land use and land management. To assess the effectiveness of such policies at a European Union (EU) scale, we simulated land use changes and their impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services indicators. We analysed a Business-as-Usual scenario, and three no-net-loss scenarios. The no-net-loss scenarios included measures that aim to reduce negative impacts of land use change on biodiversity and ecosystem services, by better implementation of existing biodiversity conservation measures (Scenario 1); and enhancement of existing measures (Scenario 2); and offsetting residual impacts on areas of high biodiversity and ecosystem service value (Scenario 3). Results show that none of the scenarios achieved overall no-net-loss. Compared to a Business-as-Usual scenario, the no-net-loss scenarios reduced the overall degree of land cover change at EU level, hence reducing impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services in large parts of the EU. The more comprehensive no-net-loss scenarios resulted in a gain of natural land cover. Moreover, natural areas became better connected, especially in pen-urban areas as a result of impact avoidance and offsetting. Richness of farmland bird species was projected to increase. Measures included in the no-net-loss scenarios had net positive effects on pollination and carbon sequestration, neutral effects on crop production, erosion prevention and flood regulation, and negative effects on nature-based recreation, compared to Business-as-Usual. In particular circumstances policy measures invoked displacement effects in land use allocation, reducing the effectiveness of the measures. This was primarily the case for flood regulation services throughout the EU. This study differentiates the potential effectiveness of a no-net-loss policy framework in three manners: (i) considering biodiversity and ecosystem services simultaneously; (ii) in the light of existing policies and land use pressures; and (iii) in different land use contexts across the EU. Taken together, we conclude that achieving no-net-loss for biodiversity and ecosystem services throughout the EU remains challenging given high land use demands. Nevertheless, in large parts of Europe there appears room for improvement for certain kinds of biodiversity and ecosystem services compared to Business-as-Usual, while still meeting other land use demands.

Extensive information exists in the literature on the highly beneficial properties of biochar. Nevertheless, systematic application of biochar on European agricultural soils may have wide ranging policy implications as well as environmental and public health concerns.

However, there are significant implementation obstacles to accessing the world's forest carbon sequestration potential. The timing of regional participation and eligibility of sequestration activities are issues. The existing forest carbon supply estimates have made optimistic assumptions about immediate, comprehensive, and global access. They have also assumed no interactions between activities and regions, and over time. We use a global forest and land use model to evaluate these assumptions with more realistic forest carbon policy pathways. We find that an afforestation only policy is fundamentally flawed, accelerated deforestation may be unavoidable, and a delayed comprehensive program could reduce, but not eliminate, near-term accelerated deforestation and eventually produce sequestration equivalent to idealized policies - but with a different sequestration mix than previously estimated by others and thereby different forests. We also find that afforestation and avoided deforestation increase the cost of one another.",,Article,2011.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7831451892852783,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
508941,A place-based approach to payments for ecosystem services,"Payment for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes are proliferating but are challenged by insufficient attention to spatial and temporal inter-dependencies, interactions between different ecosystems and their services, and the need for multi-level governance. To address these challenges, this paper develops a place-based approach to the development and implementation of PES schemes that incorporates multilevel governance, bundling or layering of services across multiple scales, and shared values for ecosystem services. The approach is evaluated and illustrated using case study research to develop an explicitly place-based PES scheme, the Peatland Code, owned and managed by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature's UK Peatland Programme and designed to pay for restoration of peatland habitats. Buyers preferred bundled schemes with premium pricing of a primary service, contrasting with sellers' preferences for quantifying and marketing services separately in a layered scheme. There was limited awareness among key business sectors of dependencies on ecosystem services, or the risks and opportunities arising from their management. Companies with financial links to peatlands or a strong environmental sustainability focus were interested in the scheme, particularly in relation to climate regulation, water quality, biodiversity and flood risk mitigation benefits. Visitors were most interested in donating to projects that benefited wildlife and were willing to donate around (sic)2 on-site during a visit. Sellers agreed a deliberated fair price per tonne of CO2 equivalent from (sic)11.18 to (sic)15.65 across four sites in Scotland, with this range primarily driven by spatial variation in habitat degradation. In the Peak District, perceived declines in sheep and grouse productivity arising from ditch blocking led to substantially higher prices, but in other regions ditch blocking was viewed more positively. The Peatland Code was developed in close collaboration with stakeholders at catchment, landscape and national scales, enabling multi-level governance of the management and delivery of ecosystem services across these scales. Place based PES schemes can mitigate negative trade-offs between ecosystem services, more effectively include cultural ecosystem services and engage with and empower diverse stakeholders in scheme design and governance.

5279121,Permission to Say “Capitalism”: Principles for Critical Social Science Engagement With GGR Research,"The grand scale of GGR deployment now necessary to avoid dangerous climate change warrants the use of grand interpretive theories of how the global economy operates. We argue that critical social science should be able to name the global economy as “capitalism”; and instead of speaking about “transforming the global economy” as a necessary precondition for limiting climate change, instead speak about transforming, or even transcending, capitalism. We propose three principles are helpful for critical social science researchers willing to name and analyse the structural features of capitalism and their relation to greenhouse gas removal technology, policy, and governance. These principles are: (1) Greenhouse Gas Removal technologies are likely to emerge within capitalism, which is crisis prone, growth dependent, market expanding, We use a broad Marxist corpus to justify this principle. (2) There are different varieties of capitalism and this will affect the feasibility of different GGR policies and supports in different nations. We draw on varieties of capitalism and comparative political economy literature to justify this principle. (3) Capitalism is more than an economic system, it is ideologically and culturally maintained. Globally-significant issues such as fundamentalism, institutional mistrust, precarity, and populism, cannot be divorced from our thinking about globally significant deployment of greenhouse gas removal technologies. We use a broad Critical Theory body of work to explore the ideational project of maintaining capitalism and its relation to GGR governance and policy.

5196741,Emission Trading System and Forest: Learning from the Experience of New Zealand,"In the area of international policy to mitigate climate change, the forest has been important in achieving the objectives of liable countries. The Emissions Trading System in New Zealand (NZ ETS) is the only case of an ETS integrating forestry as a mandatory actor. This is the result of prolonged political discussions and the characteristics of New Zealand forestry. Forest landowners are liable to surrender allowances for deforestation and can potentially receive allowances for the level of carbon sequestered. This scheme created new opportunities for forestry activities and impacted the decision-making trade-offs related to land-use changes. In Mexico, the implementation of an Emissions Trading System in 2020 is evidence of the country’s commitment to controlling domestic emissions under the Paris Agreement. Nevertheless, for now, the forestry sector is not involved as a liable actor. It is possible to envision the integration of the forest sector because of the extensive forest cover in the country, which provides a livelihood for a large part of the population. Mexico has the experience and institutional framework to integrate forestry into national emission accounting and carbon forest projects in the voluntary market. The potential impacts of this integration are both positive and negative. Environmental impacts are positive because forest areas can help mitigate emissions, but intensive carbon farming disrupts native forests and biodiversity. The economic impacts would be highly favorable for forest landowners if market volatility were controlled, but there is a potential loss of public revenue for the State. Finally, carbon forestry has the potential to cause conflict between economic sectors involved in land use and among participating communities. © 2022, The Author(s).",,Book Chapter,2022.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7808771729469299,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
4666060,"Agriculture, landscape and food value chain transformation as key engines in climate change mitigation: A review of some low-carbon policy options and implementation mechanisms","One of the most promising ways to mitigate climate change is through “agriculture and landscape climate solutions”: the conservation, restoration and improved management of agriculture and natural land in order to increase carbon storage and/or avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in landscapes worldwide. In this perspective, the agriculture sector is facing a wide rethinking on the way to better integrate environment and climate change issues into agriculture policies. Schools of thinking towards sustainable agriculture and agroecology are competing with new concepts such as sustainable land management, climate-smart agriculture and low-carbon agriculture. On the other hand, policymakers and donors face the issue of integration of mitigation and adaptation in agriculture policies and investment programmes. New performance indicators such as carbon footprint and carbon balance are used to select value and promote high-performing options. Similarly, food markets progressively provide products with reduced carbon footprint. Implementing such new and marketing mechanisms slowly induce a progressive transformation of the food value chains, agriculture policies and incentives. However, high inertia does remain in the agricultural sector, slowing down the switch towards real low-carbon agriculture options. This chapter does analyse a series of shortcuts used by countries and donors to stimulate such structural change, considering appropriate appraising tools, new incentive mechanisms, new modalities of funding and acting with scaling-up perspectives. Agroforestry value chains upgrading scenarios such as cocoa or shea parkland restoration are provided as examples of upscaling paths with high-carbon-fixing performances.The issues covered in this chapter include “environmental policy”, “sustainable agriculture”, “climate-smart agriculture”, “climate mitigation and adaptation”, “global food policy” and “low-carbon agriculture”. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",Agriculture policy; Carbon footprint; Ex-act tool; Low-carbon agriculture; Sustainable development goals; Value chains,,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7805894017219543,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Comparing a case of carbon capture and storage (CCS) with that of a nearshore windfarm in the Netherlands, I ask: how did local governmental players and their non-governmental allies succeed in getting the CCS project in Barendrecht taken off the table, while unable to block plans for the nearshore windfarm off the coast of Katwijk, Noordwijk and Zandvoort? Focusing on persuasion, I find that rhetorical framing based on expertise and 'not in my backyard' (NIMBY) escapist framing did not make much difference in either case. In the CCS case, a process of scaling up procedural critique to the national level led to repeal of the plan.

153571,Carbon sequestration and the restoration of land health - An example from Iceland,"Carbon sequestration, the conversion of greenhouse gas CO2 to organic matter, offers a powerful tool with which to combat climate change. The enlargement of carbon sinks stored in soil and biota is an essential tool in buying time while mankind seeks means to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to reduce the elevated levels of atmospheric CO2. Carbon sequestration within the context of the Kyoto Protocol of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) also has great potential as an incentive for combating land degradation and desertification and restoring fertility to degraded land. Decisions regarding carbon sinks during finalization of the operational details of the Kyoto Protocol in 2001 fit well the needs of countries facing land degradation and desertification. However, incentives for such mitigation through the Clean Development Mechanism of the protocol are limited to forestry issues. Iceland provides a good example of the multiple role of carbon sequestration in meeting national commitments to UNFCCC, conserving and restoring biological diversity, combating soil erosion, revegetation of eroded land and reforestation.

492818,The role of regulators in reducing regulatory risk: Using scenario planning to assess the regulatory framework for carbon capture and storage,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) refers to the capture, transport and storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) from emissions, to prevent it from entering the atmosphere. In order to be effective in climate change mitigation, the storage of CO2 will be required for many hundreds of years until well past the end of the fossil fuel era (www.sepa.org.uk/climate_change/solutions/carbon_capture_and_storage.aspx). It is through avoiding the release of CO2 into the atmosphere that CCS is considered to offer an opportunity to help mitigate the effects of climate change. Scotland has the potential to be the location of one of the world's first full chain CCS Projects and, although all parts of the CCS chain have been demonstrated, and the chain itself demonstrated at small scale, as confirmed by the Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute (GCCSI) in its 2011 report The Global status of CCS' there are still no examples of a full chain commercially sized CCS Project in operation anywhere in the world. There are a series of risks embedded in the development and implementation of CCS and it is the focus of Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), as the environmental regulator in Scotland alongside other regulators, to assess and manage these risks to an acceptable mitigation state and then operationalise the regulatory requirements. This article provides an overview of the issues and the process for risk management. In order to consider the effectiveness of the regulatory framework and to expose and address any potential risks ahead of any live CCS Projects, SEPA worked with the Scottish Government to develop an innovative project designed to test Scotland's regulatory framework through a novel assessment methodology based on emergency planning scenarios. The principal objectives were to identify regulatory gaps or overlaps and elements that could be streamlined or better managed, and to evaluate the risks, barriers, information gaps and any other issues that would affect the successful demonstration and deployment of CCS in Scotland.

645818,Review of the 2008 UNFCCC meeting in Poznan,"Technology transfer is a central component in policies and action to prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Without creation and adoption of suitable environmentally sound technologies it will not be possible to follow the basic principles of sustainable development. Technology transfer was expected to be a major item at the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Poznan, Poland, 1-12 December 2008, but was eclipsed by discussions on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries. However, agreement was reached on a report from the Global Environment Facility called the 'Poznan' strategic programme on technology transfer' outlining proposals to scale-up investment. At the meeting it was not possible to reach agreement on inclusion of carbon capture and storage technology under the clean development mechanism and other areas of unresolved discussion included intellectual property rights and revision of the principle of differentiated responsibility. Side-events to the main meeting provided two important indications of future directions.

155908,THE IMPORTACE OF CO2 CAPTURE AND STORAGE - A GEOPOLITICAL DISCUSSION,"The CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technology is since more than ten years considered one of the key options for the future climate change mitigation. This paper discusses the implications for the further development of CCS, particularly with respect to climate change policy in an international geopolitics context. The rationale for developing CCS should be the over-abundance of fossil fuel reserves (and resources) in a climate change context. From a geopolitical point, it can be argued that the most important outcome from the successful commercialisation of CCS will be that fossil fuel-dependent economies with large fossil fuel resources will find it easier to comply with stringent greenhouse gas reduction targets (i. e. to attach a price to CO2 emissions). This should be of great importance since, from a geopolitical view, the curbing on greenhouse gas emissions cannot be isolated from security of supply and economic competition between regions. Thus, successful application of CCS may moderate geopolitical risks related to regional differences in the possibilities and thereby willingness to comply with large emission cuts. In Europe, application of CCS will enhance security of supply by fuel diversification from continued use of coal, especially domestic lignite. Introduction of CCS will also make possible negative emissions when using biomass as a fuel, i. e. in so called Biomass Energy CCS (BECCS). Yet, the development of BECCS relies on the successful development of fossil fuelled CCS since BECCS in itself is unlikely to be sufficient for establishing a cost efficient CCS infrastructure for transport and storage and because BECCS does not solve the problem with the abundant resources of fossil fuels. Results from research and development of capture, transport and storage of CO2 indicate that the barriers for commercialization of CC'S should not be technical. Instead, the main barriers for implementation of CCS seem to be how to reach public acceptance, to reduce cost and to establish a high enough price on CO2 emissions. Failure to implement CCS will require that the global community, including Europe, agrees to almost immediately to start phasing out the use of fossil fuels, an agreement which seems rather unlikely, especially considering the abundant coal reserves in developing economies such as China and India.",carbon capture; CCS; geopolitics; CO2; greenhouse gas,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7768648862838745,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

321414,Baseload coal investment decisions under uncertain carbon legislation,"More than 50% of electricity in the U.S. is generated by coal. The U.S. has large coal resources, the cheapest fuel in most areas. Coal fired power plants are likely to continue to provide much of U.S. electricity. However, the type of power plant that should be built is unclear. Technology can reduce pollutant discharges and capture and sequester the CO2 from coal-fired generation. The U.S. Energy Policy Act of 2005 provides incentives for large scale commercial deployment of Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) systems (e.g., loan guarantees and project tax credits). This analysis examines whether a new coal plant should be Pulverized Coal (PC) or IGCC. Do stricter emissions standards (PM, SO2, NOx, Hg) justify the higher costs of IGCC over PC? How does potential future carbon legislation affect the decision to add carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology? Finally, can the impact of uncertain carbon legislation be minimized? We find that SO2, NOx, PM, and Hg emission standards would have to be far more stringent than twice current standards to justify the increased costs of the IGCC system. A CO2 tax less than $29/ton would lead companies to continuing to choose PC, paying the tax for emitted CO2. The earlier a decision-maker believes the carbon tax will be imposed and the higher the tax, the more likely companies will choose IGCC w/CCS. Having government announce the date and level of a carbon tax would promote more sensible decisions, but government would have to use a tax or subsidy to induce companies to choose the technology that is best for society.",,Article,2007.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7765032649040222,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
573815,Cap and trade policy for managing water competition from potential future carbon plantations,"Carbon sequestration from reforestation can play a large role in mitigating global climate change. However, resulting interception of rainfall runoff may impose high irrigation, water supply and/or environmental flow costs. This article presents an assessment of water trade policy to manage fresh water supply, carbon sequestration trade-offs for the Murray-Darling Basin. A linked Australian high spatial resolution land use and global integrated assessment framework evaluated plausible and internally consistent global scenarios to 2050 involving significant carbon planting incentive. Substantial flow loss from increased interception was estimated absent policy to balance carbon water trade-offs. Absent policy to address the trade-off, irrigation opportunity costs was estimated to substantially exceed carbon sequestration economic value in futures with significant carbon sequestration incentive. The value of integrating interception from new carbon plantings into the existing water trade system was estimated at $3.3 billion and $2.0 billion (2050 annual value) for our strong and moderately strong global climate action outlooks with our reference case assumptions. The conclusion that trade provision in policy to cap interception impacts can produce significant benefits in scenarios with significant carbon sequestration incentive remained robust over a very broad set of sensitivities tested with benefit estimated at over $1 billion annually at 2050 even for very conservative assumptions.

401268,CDM forestry and the ultimate objective of the climate convention,"In its Article 2, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change policymakers gave themselves a long-term dynamic mandate under uncertainty. Taking the example of forestry activities in developing countries, the present article discusses whether land-based climate change mitigation measures in the context of compensation mechanisms for human-induced greenhouse gas emissions are covered under the UNFCCC's ultimate objective. Both the problem of climate change and human intervention act over long, yet finite timeframes. The article argues for taking a dynamic 100-year timeframe as reference for present-day activities. It concludes that increasing biotic carbon storage is legitimate for measures that contribute to biodiversity conservation, as long as it does not serve as a pretext for neglecting technological change. Among all forestry options, the list of priorities should be avoiding deforestation and devegetation, sustainable forest management, and afforestation. The problem of saturation can be encountered by the combination of forestry with the increased use of wood products and bioenergy.

5303785,The Role of Corporates in Governing Carbon Dioxide Removal: Outlining a Research Agenda,"With 1,500 companies now estimated to have set net zero targets, corporate engagement with carbon dioxide removal (CDR) has gained substantial momentum. Yet despite the corporate sector becoming a key domain of CDR decision-making, corporates have not received research attention as influential actors in the governance of CDR. This paper provides a perspective on how corporates influence and enact de facto governance of CDR. We collate a preliminary evidence base regarding possible modes of CDR governance by corporates. Focusing on voluntary corporate engagement with CDR, we examine how and why firm-level decision-making takes place, and interrogate the implications of such activity. We find that the current literature focuses on techno-economic attributes of CDR solutions as drivers of corporate engagement; however, the ability for corporates to formulate a (business) case for engaging with CDR is potentially shaped by a broader array of financial and non-financial factors that are currently overlooked. This gives corporates the influence to define what and how to govern, an inherently “political act.” We finally highlight possible lenses for future research, noting lessons to be drawn from climate justice, anticipatory governance, responsible innovation, and futures literatures. These could provide a deepened understanding of the dynamics and implications of current de facto CDR governance, and allow this to be challenged where appropriate. Ultimately, without awareness and oversight of how CDR is being governed in the real world, policy and governance research may not be successful in driving us toward desired net zero futures.

276315,Protected areas: Providing natural solutions to 21st Century challenges,"Protected areas remain a cornerstone of global conservation efforts. The double impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss are major threats to achieving the Millennium Development Goals, especially those relating to environmental sustainability, poverty alleviation and food and water security. The growing awareness of the planet's vulnerability to human driven changes also provides an opportunity to re-emphasize the multiple values of natural ecosystems and the services that they provide. Protected areas, when integrated into landuse plans as part of larger and connected conservation networks, offer practical, tangible solutions to the problems of both species loss and adaptation to climate change. Natural habitats make a significant contribution to mitigation by storing and sequestering carbon in vegetation and soils, and to adaptation by maintaining essential ecosystem services which help societies to respond to, and cope with climate change and other environmental challenges. Many protected areas could be justified on socioeconomic grounds alone yet their multiple goods and services are largely unrecognized in national accounting. This paper argues that there is a convincing case for greater investment in expanded and better-connected protected area systems, under a range of governance and management regimes that are specifically designed to counter the threats of climate change, increased demand and altered patterns of resource use. The new agenda for protected areas requires greater inclusivity of a broader spectrum of actors and rights holders, with growing attention to landscapes and seascapes protected by indigenous peoples, local communities, private owners and other actors which complement conservation areas managed by state agencies. Greater attention also needs to be focused on ways to integrate and mainstream protected areas into sustainable development, including promotion of ""green"" infrastructure as a strategic part of responses to climate change. © Author(s) 2012.",,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7750328183174133,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
73374,Assessing the effects of CO2 price caps on electricity investments-A real options analysis,"This paper uses real options modeling to assess the impact of different climate change policy instruments on investment, profits and cumulative emissions in the electricity sector. Even though CO2 price caps or ""safety valves"" have been suggested as methods to limit uncertainty emanating from fluctuating prices of CO2 permits that would hurt the industry's profit and thereby also energy security, our analysis shows that price caps set at a too low level are detrimental to the adoption of e.g. modern biomass-fired capacity as a replacement for existing coal-fired power plants. We therefore conduct a series of experiments with different policy scenarios to analyze under which regime emissions are most effectively reduced. With respect to CO2 price uncertainty, it turns out that even for moderately rising CO2 prices, fluctuations frequently lead to investment into carbon capture and storage (CCS), while investment is often not triggered in the face of deterministic CO2 prices.

4373415,The UK net-zero target: Insights into procedural justice for greenhouse gas removal,"Greenhouse gas removal (GGR) is increasingly seen as a key dimension of national and international climate policy. The need to deploy a portfolio of GGR technologies in order to decarbonise sectors with the 'hardest-to-abate' emissions, particularly to achieve net-zero emissions targets, has become increasingly evident in recent years. In May 2019, the Committee on Climate Change (CCC) published a report outlining a pathway to net-zero emissions in the UK, which comprised significant contributions from engineered and land-based removals. The target of net-zero emissions has since been enshrined in UK legislation, meaning that GGR will likely be part of the UK's climate strategy. Plans for GGR deployment will therefore need to be set in motion in the short-term, in order to align with the timeframe proposed by the CCC. Despite a growing body of research examining the role governance could and should play in GGR development and deployment, there is a gap in the literature relating to the social implications of removal activities. In particular, the roles of procedural justice (PJ) and social legitimacy (SL) have not been closely examined. This study comprises an analysis of relevant legislation, combined with a series of interviews conducted in the community of Selby (a proposed location for BECCS development) in order to investigate PJ and SL in the context of GGR. It is found that the existing legal framework operates PJ as a 'tick-the-box' exercise, failing to engage a wide range of interested stakeholders or to promote meaningful engagements. Moreover, the PJ landscape for GGR is unplanned and adapted from existing legislation and cannot meet the unique needs of this novel activity, such as the need to engage the wider national public given their interest in climate change mitigation. Research in Selby corroborates these findings, revealing a range of issues with engagement procedures, including disinterest or disillusionment with processes, a lack of accessible information, and a disparity between stakeholder expectations and GGR realities. Ultimately, it is only by conducting meaningful engagements, which adequately inform and include participants, that the role of social legitimacy can truly be understood and thus leveraged.",procedural justice; social legitimacy; greenhouse gas removal; social licence; governance; net zero; negative emissions; public participation; public acceptance; engagement,Article,2020.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.7737969160079956,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Most of the research so far has focused on contribution of afforestation to carbon sequestration, afforestation schemes' uptake, social and economic efficiency and their impact on local biodiversity. Less attention has been given so far to the relevant performance of subsidy schemes' specific design in climate change adaptation, an emerging policy objective. This paper investigates adaptive capacity of subsidised afforestation projects in a Central European country. Subsidies are found to be concentrated primarily to highland regions that already have got high forest cover, with Norway spruce as the preferred tree species and a deficit of European beech, an arrangement that may undermine the payment scheme's contribution to land use adaptation to climate change. Lack of clear policy objectives and related technical subsidy design, rather than appropriation towards competing policy goals, appear to be the ultimate reason behind spatial distribution and structure of subsidised projects. Subsidy spending seems to follow recipients' choices instead of any deliberate policy priorities.

724874,The influence of institutions on the development of carbon dioxide storage and utilization applications: Carbon mineralization and geological storage,"According to IEA Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is necessary for successful climate change mitigation and would need to account for approximately 25% of total carbon dioxide reductions. EU has emphasized the need for CCS by developing incentives through the establishment of a funding programme and by including CCS into emission trading. Policy has mainly concentrated on applications based on geological storage, thus excluding the use of CCS with bioenergy and carbon mineralization. The development of emerging technologies and the influence of institutions can be analysed using a technological innovation systems (TIS) framework. This approach explores the system dynamics surrounding new technologies by analysing functions taking place in a network of actors, influenced by institutions. Institutions, both formal and informal, are the rules of the game and have the ability to affect the competition between different technological applications. The CCS TIS has developed within the existing fossil fuel regime and the formal and informal institutions are based on this regime. Therefore a larger shift in the regime and the institutions surrounding it would be required to improve conditions for the development of mineralization and CCS with bioenergy. Policy on CCS is based on forecasts that geological storage applications are likely to be successful in the future. Policy focus on geological storage has created formal institutions that can slow down or even prevent the development of carbon mineralization. These include the EU ETS, which only takes into account reductions from geological storage and the CCS directive, focused at regulating storage operations. Informal institutions, such as the use of the term CO2 utilization instead of storage to describe carbon mineralization could lead to marginalization from CCS discussion and research.",,CONF,2014.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7720676064491272,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
567370,Promoting global CCS RDD & D by stronger U.S.-China collaboration,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is the only technology available to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from large-scale fossil fuel usage. U.S. and China are the world's largest GHG emitters. Collaboration between the two nations, therefore, offers the greatest opportunity for achieving meaningful reductions in global GHG emissions. Two countries' current cooperation on CCS through Clean Energy Research Center based on the U.S.-China Strategic Forum on Clean Energy Cooperation mechanism provides an important initial step towards even closer and stronger cooperation in the future. In this paper, we justify such possibility by discourse on the seemly different but complementary social-political context in two countries including political system, government structure, economic policy, national innovation system, energy strategy, and energy market structure. We further address the key elements of future cooperation model by carefully considering the principle of equality and mutual beneficiary, the role of two countries in the whole value chain according to their comparative advantages, and the scale and mechanism of the funding. A milestone for the cooperation until 2030 is drafted and priority areas for both countries in the cooperation are identified.

635816,THE DILEMMA OF FOSSIL-FUEL USE AND GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE,"Fossil fuels present the difficult-to-reconcile dilemma that the energy systems of today's society dictate that we use great quantities of fossil fuels to produce the energy we need, but their use results in the liberation of large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is one of the so-called ''greenhouse gases''. Certain models predict that uncontrolled releases of greenhouse gases could result in unacceptable increases in global mean temperature. This dilemma is examined and a method of management of the use of fossil fuels is presented that will help to mitigate the problems their use creates. The challenge is to avoid the dilemma by technology and policy intervention so that fossil fuels are used to the net benefit of society and its environment. We should take those low-cost measures that slow greenhouse gas emissions, and we should be prepared technologically to accomplish much larger reductions if necessary. At present, our technological insurance is not in place, but the opportunities for improvement are great, even for fossil fuels. Several low-cost actions that can be taken in the near term include the establishment of policies including R&D that encourage the development of more efficient and economical end-use and conversion technologies (e.g., more efficient gas turbines, fuel cells, oxygen-blown gasifiers, and processes for producing hydrogen from fossil sources); more intensive R&D to accelerate the development of better nonfossil sources including direct solar, biomass, and other renewables, fission, and fusion; policies that encourage the substitution of hydrogen-rich for hydrogen-lean fuels and expansion of the natural gas system, particularly in developing nations; cooperation by western industrialized countries in providing technical assistance to developing and Eastern European countries for producing energy technologies that are both economically and environmentally more attractive, including expanding the development and use of the natural gas resources of the former Soviet Union; R&D to increase our understanding of the global cycle of CO2 releases to the atmosphere and its removal by the oceans and by terrestrial ecosystems so that climate stabilization targets and policies can be better established; and experiments with CO2 recovery and sequestration techniques so that the economic and environmental impacts are better understood.",,Article; Proceedings Paper,1993.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7711328268051147,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
4913543,Climate policy decision making in contexts of deep uncertainty-from optimisation to robustness,"Integrated assessment models are often used to evaluate the role of different technologies in meeting global climate goals. Such models have been criticised for failing to address the deep uncertainties and plurality of values that are fundamental to energy transitions. One consequence is that model scenarios overwhelmingly depend on large-scale carbon dioxide removal to hold warming to below 2 degrees C. Here we propose an alternative approach using Scenario-Focused Decision Analysis (SFDA) as methods that embrace decision making under deep uncertainty. SFDA can accommodate a range of value sets and perspectives, and most importantly can integrate value-based decision-making in designing climate policy. We specifically consider Robust Decision Making (RDM) as an exemplar of SFDA for developing climate policy. We outline an iterative five-stage framework for RDM using the role of carbon dioxide removal in long-term mitigation pathways as an example. The five steps comprise (i) participatory definition of goals, values, potential policy options and uncertainties; (ii) modelling the performance of policy portfolios across a wide range of future scenarios; (iii) visualisation and identification of portfolio vulnerabilities; (iv) analysis of trade-offs; and (v) development of policy strategies. SFDA, and specifically RDM, provide untapped opportunities for diverse actors to explore alternative mitigation pathways and evaluate the robustness of climate policy choices through ""deliberation with analysis"".

1976809,Demand-side approaches for limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C,"The Paris Climate Agreement defined an ambition of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees C above preindustrial levels. This has triggered research on stringent emission reduction targets and corresponding mitigation pathways across energy economy and societal systems. Driven by methodological considerations, supply side and carbon dioxide removal options feature prominently in the emerging pathway literature, while much less attention has been given to the role of demand-side approaches. This special issue addresses this gap, and aims to broaden and strengthen the knowledge base in this key research and policy area. This editorial paper synthesizes the special issue's contributions horizontally through three shared themes we identify: policy interventions, demand-side measures, and methodological approaches. The review of articles is supplemented by insights from other relevant literature. Overall, our paper underlines that stringent demand-side policy portfolios are required to drive the pace and direction of deep decarbonization pathways and keep the 1.5 degrees C target within reach. It confirms that insufficient attention has been paid to demand-side measures, which are found to be inextricably linked to supply-side decarbonization and able to complement supply-side measures. The paper also shows that there is an abundance of demand-side measures to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C, but it warns that not all of these options are seen or captured by current quantitative tools or progress indicators, and some remain insufficiently represented in the current policy discourse. Based on the set of papers presented in the special issue, we conclude that demand-side mitigation in line with the 1.5 degrees C goal is possible; however, it remains enormously challenging and dependent on both innovative technologies and policies, and behavioral change. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C requires, more than ever, a plurality of methods and integrated behavioral and technology approaches to better support policymaking and resulting policy interventions.",Behavioral change; Demand-side approaches; Energy efficiency; Climate change mitigation; Low-carbon energy technologies; Paris Climate Agreement; Mitigation pathways; Policy instruments; 1.5 degrees C target,Editorial Material,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7701847553253174,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology takes up a promising position in the achievement of a low-carbon future. Currently, CCS projects are implemented not only for CO2 storage but also for its usage in industries, in conformity with the principles of a circular economy. To date, a number of countries have accumulated experience in launching and implementing CCS projects. At the same time, the peculiarities and pace of technology development around the world remain different. This paper attempts to identify key factors that, first, generally affect CCS projects deployment, and second, create favorable conditions for CCS technologies development. Based on an extensive literature review and the experience of different countries, classification and interpretation of these factors are offered, justifying their impact on CCS projects. As a result of this paper, the authors present an assessment of the maturity of policy incentives and regulations in the field of CCS for different countries with revealed dependence between the level and effectiveness of CCS projects' implementation, confirming the adequacy of the offered approaches and identifying measures that ensure success in CCS.

We specifically consider: What risks does the deployment of these options entail? What types of tradeoffs may emerge through their deployment? We apply a framework that clusters risk–risk tradeoffs into institutional and governance, technological and environmental, and behavioral and temporal dimensions. In doing so, we offer a more complete inventory of risk–risk tradeoffs than those currently available within the respective risk-assessment, energy-systems, and climate-change literatures, and we also point the way toward future research gaps concerning policy, deployment, and risk management. © 2022 The Authors.

4484275,Climate Policy Imbalance in the Energy Sector: Time to Focus on the Value of CO2 Utilization,"Global warming is an existential threat to humanity and the rapid energy transition, which is required, will be the defining social, political and technical challenge of the 21st century. Practical experience and research results of recent years have showed that our actions to cover the gap between real situation and aims of climate agreements are not enough and that improvements in climate policy are needed, primarily in the energy sector. It is becoming increasingly clear that hydrocarbon resources, which production volume is increasing annually, will remain a significant part of the global fuel balance in the foreseeable future. Taking this into account, the main problem of the current climate policy is a limited portfolio of technologies, focused on replacement of hydrocarbon resources with renewable energy, without proper attention to an alternative ways of decreasing carbon intensity, such as carbon sequestration options. This study shows the need to review the existing climate policy portfolios through reorientation to CO2 utilization and disposal technologies and in terms of forming an appropriate appreciation for the role of hydrocarbon industries as the basis for the development of CO2-based production chains. In this paper we argue that: (1) focusing climate investments on a limited portfolio of energy technologies may become a trap that keeps us from achieving global emissions goals; (2) accounting for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions losses, without taking into account the potential social effects of utilization, is a barrier to diversifying climate strategies; (3) with regard to hydrocarbon industries, a transition from destructive to creative measures aimed at implementing environmental projects is needed; (4) there are no cheap climate solutions, but the present cost of reducing CO2 emissions exceeds any estimate of the social cost of carbon.",climate policy; carbon tax; CO2 costs; value of CO2 utilization; hydrocarbons; energy sector; carbon capture; carbon utilization; carbon storage; climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7660825252532959,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
1779775,Highlights and Lessons from the EU CCS Demonstration Project Network,"The European Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Demonstration Project Network (the ""Network"") is currently composed of projects located in the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, and the UK. The goal of the Network is to accelerate deployment of CCS by sharing project development experiences about technology implementation, including transport and storage of CO2, as well as regulatory environment and financial structures. This paper aims to provide an overview of some CCS insights gained from developing the Network projects. Besides technology and project development, sharing knowledge and lessons learned on project-level basis, have also given valuable insights on how policies can enable development and implementation of appropriate regulatory frameworks, and funding schemes towards effective deployment of CCS technology in power generation sector.

5196357,Upstream decarbonization through a carbon takeback obligation: An affordable backstop climate policy,"In the absence of immediate, rapid, and unprecedented reduction in global demand for carbon-intensive energy and products, the capture and permanent storage of billions of tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) annually will be needed before mid-century to meet Paris Agreement goals. Yet the focus on absolute emission reductions and cheaper, more temporary forms of carbon storage means that permanent CO2 disposal remains starved of investment, currently deployed to capture only about 0.1% of global Energy and Industrial Process (EIP) emissions. This stored fraction, the percentage of fossil EIP emissions that are captured and permanently stored, must reach 100% to stop EIP emissions causing further global warming. Here, we show that a cost-effective transition can occur by mandating an increasing stored fraction through a progressive carbon takeback obligation (CTBO) on fossil carbon producers and importers. By emulating the behavior of an integrated assessment model (IAM) and employing conservative assumptions for the costs of permanent carbon storage, we show that projected economywide costs of a CTBO policy are comparable to the costs associated with achieving similarly ambitious climate goals in IAMs employing a global carbon price, or potentially lower if the perceived policy risk cost associated with a CTBO is lower than that associated with a politically determined carbon price. Compared with a global carbon price, an upstream CTBO has advantages of simple governance, speed, and controllability: equivalent carbon prices under a CTBO are reliably capped by the cost of direct air capture and storage, by ensuring deployment keeps pace with continued fossil fuel use, reducing the risk of punitive carbon prices or more draconian measures being needed to drive out the final tranche of emissions. When combined with measures to reduce CO2 production in the near-term, a CTBO could deliver a viable pathway to achieving net-zero emissions consistent with 1.5 degrees C by mid-century.",,Review,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7656587958335876,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
179043,Stakeholder perceptions towards the transition to a hydrogen economy in Poland,"Poland has significant reserves of energy in the form of coal. However, the exploitation of these reserves could lead to significant carbon emissions. Hydrogen technologies present a potentially sustainable option for the Polish energy system. This paper reviews the existing Polish energy system, resources, policies and measures from the perspective of planning a transition to a hydrogen-based economy. The key challenges and opportunities gathered by systematic consultation of senior stakeholders are presented. Coke oven gas and coal gasification are the major short and medium term sources of hydrogen. Underground conversion of coal deposits with integrated carbon capture and storage (CCS) is most important in the long term. Other opportunities include development of renewables, by-product hydrogen and nuclear power. Current lack of infrastructure, particularly for CCS, hydrogen pipelines and clean coal is seen as a significant barrier. Regional and central government should cooperate with industry to develop a portfolio of demonstration projects to provide experience and stimulate demand for hydrogen.

5279017,Innovative financing for peatland restoration in indonesia,"Indonesia harbors the largest area of tropical peatland globally, with a total area of approximately 15 million hectares (Mha) and store about 45–65 GtC which is strategically important for controlling global climate change. However, Indonesia’s peatland experiences an alarming rate of degradation in recent decades due to anthropogenic activities such as logging, conversion to industrial timber and agriculture, fires, and drainage associated with these land use changes. Peatland degradation imposes socio-economic, environmental consequences, and health costs to the country. In order to reverse the peatlands degradation pace, President Joko Widodo enacted a Presidential Regulation Number 1 of 2016 concerning the establishment of Peatland Restoration Agency or Badan Restorasi Gambut (BRG). The newly ad hoc governmental agency is tasked to coordinate and facilitate stakeholders in implementing peatlands restoration of 2.0 Mha target in seven provinces up to 2020. The 2.0 Mha target is then revised and updated based on certain criteria to a new target of 2.49 Mha. Of the 2.49 Mha target, about 1.40 Mha is located within private concessionaire licensed areas; meanwhile, the remaining 1.09 Mha is allocated in non-private licensed areas. A substantial budget is needed to achieve restoration target aforementioned. The currently available funding from both state budget and bilateral donor countries remains inadequate to fill in the funding needed, which is an estimate of total US$ 1.70 billion for the whole 2.49 Mha target. Hence, strategic and innovative funding sources need to be created and tapped in order to address the funding gap. This chapter aims to present business cases for peatland restoration and to propose a potential innovative financial instrument to finance the restoration activities in Indonesia. The creation of an investment instrument is necessary by means of structuring a peat bond where a combination of cash and carbon asset returns can be gained by investors. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Book Chapter,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7642354369163513,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
270709,"Including land use, land-use change, and forestry in future climate change, agreements: thinking outside the box","This paper presents a framework that encompasses a full range of options for including land use, land-use change, and forestry (LULUCF) within future agreements under the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The intent is to provide options that can address the broad range of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and removals as well as to bring the broadest possible range of nations into undertaking mitigation efforts. We suggest that the approach taken for the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period is only one within a much larger universe of possible approaches. This larger universe includes partially or completely ""cle-linking"" LULUCF commitments from those in other sectors, and allowing commitments specified in terms other than tonnes of greenhouse gases. Such approaches may provide clarity and transparency concerning the role of the various sectors in the agreements and encourage participation in agreements by a more inclusive, diverse set of countries, resulting in a more effective use of LULUCF in addressing climate change.

1024037,Land restoration in food security programmes: synergies with climate change mitigation,"Food-insecure households in many countries depend on international aid to alleviate acute shocks and chronic shortages. Some food security programmes (including Ethiopia's Productive Safety Net Program-PSNP - which provides a case study for this article) have integrated aid in exchange for labour on public works to reduce long-term dependence by investing in the productive capacity and resilience of communities. Using this approach, Ethiopia has embarked upon an ambitious national programme of land restoration and sustainable land management. Although the intent was to reduce poverty, here we show that an unintended co-benefit is the climate-change mitigation from reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increased landscape carbon stocks. The article first shows that the total reduction in net GHG emissions from PSNP's land management at the national scale is estimated at 3.4 millionMgCO(2)ey(-1) - approximately 1.5% of the emissions reductions in Ethiopia's Nationally Determined Contribution for the Paris Agreement. The article then explores some of the opportunities and constraints to scaling up of this impact.Key policy insights Food security programmes (FSPs) can contribute to climate change mitigation by creating a vehicle for investment in land and ecosystem restoration.Maximizing mitigation, while enhancing but not compromising food security, requires that climate projections, and mitigation and adaptation responses should be mainstreamed into planning and implementation of FSPs at all levels.Cross-cutting oversight is required to integrate land restoration, climate policy, food security and disaster risk management into a coherent policy framework.Institutional barriers to optimal implementation should be addressed, such as incentive mechanisms that reward effort rather than results, and lack of centralized monitoring and evaluation of impacts on the physical environment.Project implementation can often be improved by adopting best management practices, such as using productive living livestock barriers where possible, and increasing the integration of agroforestry and non-timber forest products into landscape regeneration.",Climate change mitigation; food security; carbon sequestration; land restoration; sustainable land management; climate-smart agriculture,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.761955976486206,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
3170830,Decision making in contexts of deep uncertainty - An alternative approach for long-term climate policy,"The majority of global emissions scenarios compatible with holding global warming to less than 2 degrees C depend on the large-scale use of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) to compensate for an overshoot of atmospheric CO2 budgets. Recent critiques have highlighted the ethical and environmental risks of this strategy and the danger of building long-term climate policy on such speculative technological scenarios emerging from integrated assessment models. Here, we critically examine both the use of BECCS in mitigation scenarios and the decision making philosophy underlying the use of integrated assessment modelling to inform climate policy. We identify a number of features of integrated assessment models that favour selection of BECCS over alternative strategies. However, we argue that the deeper issue lies in the tendency to view model outputs as objective science, capable of defining ""optimal"" goals and strategies for which climate policy should strive, rather than as exploratory tools within a broader policy development process. This model-centric decision making philosophy is highly sensitive to uncertainties in model assumptions and future trends, and tends to favour solutions that perform well within the model framework at the expense of a wider mix of strategies and values. Drawing on the principles of Robust Decision Making, we articulate the need for an alternative approach that explicitly embraces uncertainty, multiple values and diversity among stakeholders and viewpoints, and in which modelling exists in an iterative exchange with policy development rather than separate from it. Such an approach would provide more relevant and robust information to near-term policymaking, and enable an inclusive societal dialogue about the appropriate role for carbon dioxide removal within climate policy.",International climate policy; Carbon dioxide removal technologies; Integrated assessment modelling; Predict then act; Robust decision making; Diversity in value-sets,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7618361711502075,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

94955,Climate Engineering and the Cessation Requirement: The Ethics of a Life-Cycle,"Much of the work on the ethics of climate engineering over the last few years has focused on the front-end of the potential timeline for climate intervention. Topics have included the initial taboo on bringing the discussion of climate engineering into the open, guidelines to put in place before commencing research, and governance arrangements before first deployment. While this work is clearly important, the current paper considers what insights can be gleaned from considering the tail-end, that is, by using the requirement for future cessation as a criterion for any acceptable climate engineering strategy. After showing that time-limited interventions are a key part of the rhetoric of leading climate engineering advocates, the paper examines the implications of imposing a 'cessation requirement' on solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal strategies. Consideration of a cessation requirement turns out to reveal a great deal about what ought to be happening now, before any decision to proceed with climate engineering deployment has been taken.",Climate engineering; cessation requirement; restoration; carbon dioxide removal (CDR); solar radiation management (SRM),Article,2016.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7597500085830688,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

A bottom-up simulation model is used to evaluate different policy scenarios. The results show that CCS plays only a moderate role for gradually rising CO2 prices. By using the scale advantages in CO2 transport already for the first CCS plants comparable to the level of large scale transport, the competitiveness of CCS is improved considerably. Furthermore, our results indicate that different policy options stimulate different types of CCS technologies. Finally, stimulating CCS and renewable energy sources simultaneously is more cost effective in the long run than stimulating solely CCS. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

5342578,"The policy discourse on negative emissions, land-based technologies, and the Global South","Negative emissions are increasingly seen as a policy option to limit climate change. However, the most readily available technologies that could deliver negative emissions require, if deployed at scale, large amounts of land, with huge risks for livelihoods and the environment. This land is often assumed to be in the Global South. This article analyzes the nascent policy discourse on negative emissions by assessing 116 policy documents by 97 organizations with a focus on land-based technologies (afforestation and reforestation, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, biochar, soil carbon sequestration). We conclude that this policy discourse is largely centered in the Global North (mostly in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany), with only five organizations directly linked to the Global South. 61% of the organizations in our sample, however, somehow refer to the Global South in their contributions, with nongovernmental organizations being most strongly focused on the role of the Global South and in particular the risks for vulnerable countries. While the earlier policy discourse on negative emissions was linked to a more general “geoengineering” discourse, this link has loosened in the last years. Overall, in the documents that we studied, negative emissions technologies seem to become more accepted, and parts of the discourse shift towards deployment. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage seems more often associated with risks if compared to other land-based negative emissions technologies, especially with a view to the Global South. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,2022.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7591666579246521,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1563482,Demand-side approaches for limiting global warming to 1.5 °C,"The Paris Climate Agreement defined an ambition of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels. This has triggered research on stringent emission reduction targets and corresponding mitigation pathways across energy economy and societal systems. Driven by methodological considerations, supply side and carbon dioxide removal options feature prominently in the emerging pathway literature, while much less attention has been given to the role of demand-side approaches. This special issue addresses this gap, and aims to broaden and strengthen the knowledge base in this key research and policy area. This editorial paper synthesizes the special issue’s contributions horizontally through three shared themes we identify: policy interventions, demand-side measures, and methodological approaches. The review of articles is supplemented by insights from other relevant literature. Overall, our paper underlines that stringent demand-side policy portfolios are required to drive the pace and direction of deep decarbonization pathways and keep the 1.5 °C target within reach. It confirms that insufficient attention has been paid to demand-side measures, which are found to be inextricably linked to supply-side decarbonization and able to complement supply-side measures. The paper also shows that there is an abundance of demand-side measures to limit warming to 1.5 °C, but it warns that not all of these options are “seen” or captured by current quantitative tools or progress indicators, and some remain insufficiently represented in the current policy discourse. Based on the set of papers presented in the special issue, we conclude that demand-side mitigation in line with the 1.5 °C goal is possible; however, it remains enormously challenging and dependent on both innovative technologies and policies, and behavioral change. Limiting warming to 1.5 °C requires, more than ever, a plurality of methods and integrated behavioral and technology approaches to better support policymaking and resulting policy interventions. © 2019, The Author(s).",1.5 °C target; Behavioral change; Climate change mitigation; Demand-side approaches; Energy efficiency; Low-carbon energy technologies; Mitigation pathways; Paris Climate Agreement; Policy instruments; Carbon dioxide; Decarbonization; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Knowledge based systems; Behavioral changes; Climate agreement; Climate change mitigation; Demand-side; Low-carbon energy technology; Mitigation pathways; Policy instruments; Global warming,Editorial,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7590578198432922,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
676506,"Geoengineering, Ocean Fertilization, and the Problem of Permissible Pollution","Many geoengineering projects have been proposed to address climate change, including both solar radiation management and carbon removal techniques. Some of these methods would introduce additional compounds into the atmosphere or the ocean. This poses a difficult conundrum: Is it permissible to remediate one pollutant by introducing a second pollutant into a system that has already been damaged, threatened, or altered? We frame this conundrum as the ""Problem of Permissible Pollution.'' In this paper, we explore this problem by taking up ocean fertilization and advancing an argument that rests on three moral claims. We first observe that pollution is, in many respects, a context-dependent matter. This observation leads us to argue for a ""justifiability criterion.'' Second, we suggest that remediating actions must take into account the antecedent conditions that have given rise to their consideration. We call this second observation the ""antecedent conditions criterion.'' Finally, we observe that ocean fertilization, and other related geoengineering technologies, propose not strictly to clean up carbon emissions, but actually to move the universe to some future, unknown state. Given the introduced criteria, we impose a ""future-state constraint''. We conclude that ocean fertilization is not an acceptable solution for mitigating climate change. In attempting to shift the universe to a future state (a) geoengineering sidelines consideration of the antecedent conditions that have given rise to it-conditions, we note, that in many cases involve unjustified carbon emissions -and (b) it must appeal to an impossibly large set of affected parties.",geoengineering; climate change; remediation; ethics; policy; carbon sequestration; ocean fertilization,Article,2011.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7589932084083557,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

A bottom-up approach is adopted to explore the relative contribution of different land-based activities in the region and explore the Scottish policy context and the scope for emissions reduction through new tree planting. It is concluded that the institutional architecture is incomplete, in that although the Rural Development Programme supports afforestation, informal institutions,especially farmer antipathy, militate against afforestation. Ground-truthing indicates scope for major efficiency gains in emissions reduction if tradable solutions are pursued. There is scope for policy enhancement and, if land use sector carbon emissions were offset against farm-produced renewable energy and carbon emissions were taxed, a significant flow of money from low ground farms to the disadvantaged hill areas would be likely, as these areas have the greatest potential with respect to climate change mitigation. © 2012 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.",,JOUR,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7585000395774841,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
328310,Environmental bonds and the challenge of long-term carbon sequestration,"The potential to capture carbon from industrial Sources and dispose of it for the long-term, known as carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), is widely recognized as an important option to reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide emissions. Specifically, CCS has the potential to provide emissions cuts sufficient to stabilize greenhouse gas levels, while still allowing for the continued use of fossil fuels. In addition, CCS is both technologically-feasible and commercially viable compared with alternatives with the same emissions profile. Although the concept appears to be solid from a technical perspective, initial public perceptions of the technology are uncertain. Moreover, little attention has been paid to developing an understanding of the social and political institutional infrastructure necessary to implement CCS projects. In this paper we explore a particularly dicey issue-how to ensure adequate long-term monitoring and maintenance of the carbon sequestration sites. Bonding mechanisms have been Suggested as a potential mechanism to reduce these problems (where bonding refers to financial instruments used to ensure regulatory or contractual commitments). Such mechanisms have been successfully applied in a number of settings (e.g., to ensure court appearances, completion of construction projects, and payment of taxes). The paper examines the use of bonding to address environmental problems and looks at its possible application to nascent CCS projects. We also present evidence on the use of bonding for other projects involving deep underground injection of materials for the purpose of long-term storage or disposal.

4403239,The Design of Markets for Soil Carbon Sequestration,"There is great potential for soil carbon sequestration to contribute to climate change mitigation. However, there are a number of difficulties in measuring and verifying soil carbon sequestration for market-based policies for soil carbon sequestration. In particular, measurement costs and other transaction costs will ultimately determine the practicality of any policy. The relationship between soil carbon spatial heterogeneity, measurement precision and measurement costs is central to the design of contracts for soil carbon sequestration. Importantly, these factors determine the practicality of policy alternatives and the efficiency of alternative contract designs. The details of contract design change the incentives faced by landholders as well as the allocation of risk between sellers and buyers. For example, some contract designs link payments to alternative land management practices whereas others link payments to directly measured outcomes. Research in soil science provides the knowledge necessary to link land use and management to sequestration and the measurement approaches required to verify sequestration. Careful consideration of these factors in market design is needed to determine whether potential benefits outweigh the costs of implementing any policy intended to promote soil carbon sequestration. © 2013 The Economic Society of Australia",,Article,2013.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7559939026832581,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

318060,THE COPENHAGEN ACCORD: A CATASTROFIC WARM FUTURE. DO WE NEED A PLAN B?,"The Copenhagen Accord (December 2009) underlines that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time and emphasizes the political will to urgently combat it, in accordance with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. Also, it recognizes that deep cuts in global emissions of greenhouse gases are required to maintain the temperature increase below 2 degrees C; the limit to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system. Unfortunately, the proposed emission reduction commitments (mitigation) submitted to the Accord fall short of required levels. From the analysis of the present situation, a significant global warming during the current century appears to be inevitable, with likely catastrophic increases of temperature (4 degrees C by 2100). Urgently, all countries should establish comprehensive adaptation programs. Furthermore, in order to alleviate the situation, it will be necessary to appeal to all the available mitigation options, including short lived compounds and atmospheric CO2 sequestration techniques. The participation of developing countries is crucial, as they currently contribute with similar to 58% of global emissions, which are growing substantially. On the other hand, to confront an eventual climatic crisis, it may be a good idea to develop a plan B. At present, several geoengineering proposals which could counteract warming in a relatively short time after implementation, such as injection of sulfur compounds in the stratosphere, are being discussed. This would give some extra time for mitigation options, the real solution. Obviously, the intentional alteration of the climate system could have negative environmental consequences, which should be fully investigated before proceeding.",,Article,2010.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7551575899124146,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The policy routes are based on the decarbonised scenarios of the EU Energy Roadmap 2050 combining energy efficiency, renewables, nuclear or carbon capture and storage (CCS). A ""reference and seven decarbonised scenarios are modelled for EU28. We conclude on the importance of policy decisions for the configuration of the low carbon power sector, especially on nuclear acceptance and available sites for new RES plants. Differently from typical analysis focussing on technology portfolio for each route, we analyse the deployment of each technology across policy routes, for optimising technology R & D. R & D priority should be given to those less-policy-sensitive technologies that are in any case deployed rapidly across the modelled time horizon (e.g. PV), but also to those deployed up to their technical potentials and typically less sensitive to exogenous policy routes. For these 'no regret' technologies (e.g. geothermal), R & D efforts should focus on increasing their technical potential.

Here, we present an overview of science and policy aspects related to this goal and analyse the implications for mitigation pathways. We show examples of discernible differences in impacts between 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C warming. At the same time, most available low emission scenarios at least temporarily exceed the 1.5 degrees C limit before 2100. The legacy of temperature overshoots and the feasibility of limiting warming to 1.5 degrees C, or below, thus become central elements of a post-Paris science agenda.

5226071,Co-producing climate policy and negative emissions: trade-offs for sustainable land-use,"Non-technical summary. Under the Paris Agreement, nations have committed to preventing dangerous global warming. Scenarios for achieving net-zero emissions in the second half of this century depend on land (forests and bioenergy) to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Modelled levels of land-based mitigation could reduce the availability of productive agricultural land, and encroach on natural land, with potentially significant social and environmental consequences. However, these issues are poorly recognized in the policy-uptake of modelled outputs. Understanding how science and policy interact to produce expectations about mitigation pathways allows us to consider the trade-offs inherent in relying on land for mitigation. Technical summary. Science enables better understanding of climate change causes and impacts but may also define the 'climate problem' in technical terms, with technical solutions, as seen in the recent inclusion of negative emissions technologies (NETs) in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) to meet the Paris Agreement's temperature goals. This paper examines the sustainability of land-based carbon removal, using a co-production lens to explain the legitimization of NETs as key mitigation options. We evaluate the scale of NETs in the most recent generation of <2 degrees C scenarios, finding that projected levels of land-based mitigation imply strong trade-offs with other societal goals. Future demand for bioenergy from dedicated cropland drives large-scale land-use change across all models. Upper ranges of modelled outputs would require up to a doubling of global cropland, with potential losses of up to a quarter of both current pasture and natural lands by 2100. We find that the perception of model-based knowledge as 'objective science' lends authority to outcomes that might otherwise be more critically debated and contested. Closer engagement between modellers and policy experts for mitigation scenario development would allow for more negotiated forms of knowledge production that might better clarify and represent the multiple objectives and interests at stake in the utilization of limited land resources.",food security; land use; modelling and simulation; policies; politics and governance,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7514896392822266,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
559721,Future restrictions for sinks in the CDM - How about a cap on supply?,"The first commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol is expected to result in only a small role for the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), including afforestation and reforestation projects. Wide ranging concerns regarding sinks in the CDM have been reflected in the Marrakech Accords capping the total amount of emission offsets from sinks projects to be used by Annex I countries. Decisions about the second commitment period and beyond are likely to be of far greater importance for these projects. This paper contributes to the discussion on how caps on sinks under the CDM could be used to obtain overall improved outcomes for developing countries. We examine two distinctive ways in which quantitative caps on sinks in the CDM can be implemented: one, restricting the use of sinks CERs to meet targets, as under the Marrakech Accords (a cap on demand); and two, restricting supply of sink CERs using a quota system. We argue in favour of a supply side cap, if Parties are to preserve the idea of limiting sinks in the CDM. Limiting the supply of credits could lead to better financial outcomes for developing countries as a whole, make higher-cost projects viable which may have better sustainability impacts, and provide an alternative to deal with equity concerns between developing countries.

899081,"Wetlands In a Changing Climate: Science, Policy and Management","Part 1 of this review synthesizes recent research on status and climate vulnerability of freshwater and saltwater wetlands, and their contribution to addressing climate change (carbon cycle, adaptation, resilience). Peatlands and vegetated coastal wetlands are among the most carbon rich sinks on the planet sequestering approximately as much carbon as do global forest ecosystems. Estimates of the consequences of rising temperature on current wetland carbon storage and future carbon sequestration potential are summarized. We also demonstrate the need to prevent drying of wetlands and thawing of permafrost by disturbances and rising temperatures to protect wetland carbon stores and climate adaptation/resiliency ecosystem services. Preventing further wetland loss is found to be important in limiting future emissions to meet climate goals, but is seldom considered. In Part 2, the paper explores the policy and management realm from international to national, subnational and local levels to identify strategies and policies reflecting an integrated understanding of both wetland and climate change science.

Bangladesh has a special interest in strategies for combating global warming because its large areas that need to be planted represent a potentially large carbon sink, and at the same time its high rate of deforestation represents a huge carbon source. To properly assign carbon credits within the forestry sector of Bangladesh, a number of important issues and uncertainties need to be examined and resolved. Afforestation and reforestation (A/R) offers opportunities for carbon credits, which is subject to the end-use of the forest products. A/R may be the best option, as well as conserving the existing carbon sink offered by Bangladesh for mitigating global warming. This article discusses the legal issues raised in combating global warming; the potential of the Bangladesh forestry sector to combat global warming; implications of the forestry options for different land uses; and issues to be settled regarding carbon credits.

This is widely agreed upon in a long-term perspective, but it remains unclear which costs will be incurred when agriculture contributes in this way to climate change mitigation. When looking at the opportunity costs of reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions which arise from the cessation of land use on peatland, conservation and restoration of peatland is indeed a cost-efficient instrument for greenhouse gas reduction. However, this varies greatly between different regions and depends on the existing type of land use. Our analysis shows that the necessary measures that would need to accompany a cessation of land use on peatland are absent. The existing regulatory and support framework does not follow ecological criteria - it evens runs counter to species and climate protection. This problem can only be solved by a fundamental reorientation of the funding conditions in agriculture. The effects for species and water protection are difficult to quantify. In this situation, greenhouse gas abatement costs provide a useful instrument to measure future subsidy and support schemes against their overall benefits for society. For such schemes to succeed, however, it will be essential that they are balanced by the creation of added value on the regional scale.",,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7501269578933716,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
342264,Design considerations for financing a national trust to advance the deployment of geologic CO2 storage and motivate best practices,"This paper explores how the widely held public policy view of the evolution of the risk profile associated with geologic carbon dioxide (CO2) storage profoundly influences the public policy dialogue about how to best address the long-term risk profile for geologic storage. Evidence emerging from research and pilot scale field demonstrations Of CO2 storage demonstrates that, with proper site characterization and sound operating practices. retention of stored CO2 Will increase with time thus invalidating the premise of an ever growing risk The authors focus on key Issues of fit, interplay, and scalability associated with the ability of a trust fund funded by a hypothetical $1 per tonCO(2) tipping fee for each ton of CO2 stored in the United States under WRE450 and WRE550 climate policies to manage such risks in an economically efficient and environmentally effective manner. The authors conclude there is no intrinsic value - in terms of risk management or risk reduction - in creating a trust fund predicated solely on collecting a universally applied tipping fee that does not take into account site-specific risk profiles if left to grow unchecked. a trust fund that is predicated on a constant stream of payments unrelated to each contributing site's risk profile could result in the accumulation of hundreds of billions to more than a trillion dollars contributing to significant opportunity Cost of capital Further. rather than mitigating the financial consequences of long-term CCS risks. this analysis suggests a blanket $1 per tonCO(2) tipping fee, if combined with a concomitant limitation of liability may increase the probability and frequency of long-term risk by eliminating financial incentives for sound operating behavior and site selection criteria-contribute to moral hazard At a minimum, effective use of a trust fund requires (1) strong oversight regarding site selection and fund management, and (2) a clear process by which the fund is periodically Valued and funds collected are mapped to the risk profile of the pool of covered CCS sites. Without appropriate checks and balances. there is no a prion reason to believe that the amount of funds held in trust will map to the actual amount of funds needed to address long-term care expenses and delimited compensatory damages For this reason, the authors conclude that financing a trust fund or other risk management instrument should be based on a site delimited estimate of potential future expected financial consequences rather than oil the random adoption of a fixed funding stream, e g, a blanket $1 per ton. because it ""sounds"" reasonable (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved",Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Long-term CO2 storage integrity; Liability risk management; Financial responsibility; Tipping fee; Trust fund,Article; Proceedings Paper,2010.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7492485046386719,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
590737,Soils as carbon sinks: the global context,"Soil carbon sequestration could meet at most about one-third of the current yearly increase in atmospheric CO2-carbon, but the duration of the effect would be limited, with significant impacts lasting only 20-50 years. Coupled with this limited duration, increases in population and per-capita energy demand mean that soil carbon sequestration could play only a minor role in closing the difference between predicted and target carbon emissions by 2100. However, if atmospheric CO2 concentrations are to be stabilized at reasonable levels (450-650 ppm), drastic reductions in carbon emissions will be required over the next 20-30 years. Given this, carbon sequestration should form a central role in any portfolio of measures to reduce atmospheric CO2 concentrations over this crucial period, while new energy technologies are developed and implemented. International agreements, such as the Kyoto Protocol, encourage soil carbon sequestration and could be used to formulate soil carbon sequestration polices. Such policies need to take account of other environmental impacts as well as political, economic and societal needs, so that they form part of a raft of measures encouraging sustainable development.

Many countries now face the challenge to find cost-effective ways to deploy low-carbon technologies in order to meet commitments to the Paris Agreement. Process systems engineering (PSE) can play an essential role in supporting high-level policy decisions to help mitigate climate change. Within PSE, carbon-constrained planning will become increasingly critical for policy-making on provision of sustainable energy in electricity generation as well as other economic sectors. There are existing carbon-constrained planning tools but these often consider energy issues from limited perspectives at specific scales. In this perspective paper, we argue for a Process-to-Policy framework that centres on carbon-constrained planning which includes various stakeholders at various scales for developing strategies to address global warming.

737246,Encouraging low carbon policies through a Local Emissions Trading Scheme (LETS),"Local authorities are important actors to mitigate climate change. They can implement policies which can reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in sectors like transport, waste, agriculture and land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF). They can also implement policies which can increase carbon dioxide removals. The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS) is one of the most important initiatives to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in the EU. It is a cap and trade scheme encompassing almost half of the European-wide carbon dioxide emissions. However, carbon dioxide removals and sectors associated with local authorities' responsibilities are not included in the EU ETS. The main objective of this paper is to propose an original cap and trade system, called LETS, designed to involve local authorities. The LETS was then tested and applied to all the local authorities in the mainland of Portugal covering emissions and removals of a single greenhouse gas (carbon dioxide) in the LULUCF and the transport sectors. The system proved to have the necessary conditions to be implemented and adaptable to other country contexts. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

1097630,The Flagship South West Hub Project: Approach towards developing a green-field industrial scale CCS project in Western Australia,"Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is a potential stepping stone to maintaining energy security while reducing the carbon footprint of Australia's energy sources. CCS, which involves capturing carbon dioxide that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere and injecting it to be stored in deep geological formations, is the only technology available to make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions while still using fossil fuels and much of today's energy infrastructure. At a State level, the Western Australian Greenhouse Strategy incorporates CCS and is helping to address the need for a long-term commitment to climate change and cleaner energy. The Government of Western Australia Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP) commenced investigating a site near large CO2 emission sources (the industrial centres of Kwinana and Collie in South-West Western Australia) in 2007 and developed the South West Hub (SW Hub) project concept in 2009 with the support of local industrial partners in the form of a Joint Venture (JV). The project was designated an ""Australian Flagship"" project in 2011 and has received substantial funding and support from the Australian Federal Government, the Western Australia (WA) State Government and industry. The project has concurrently considered the various aspects required for an industrial scale development. The DMP has launched the technical investigations required to build confidence in the site and in parallel moved to amend the WA State Petroleum and Geothermal Legislation to include onshore geological storage of greenhouse gases. This is expected to pass in 2014-15, following which acreage release can occur. The ongoing and planned technical and exploration well drilling work is thus classified under the pre-competitive data acquisition phase and will allow the regulators to have comprehensive data packages to support tenement releases for CCS in the future. Community engagement has been given great importance, a formal strategy developed, workshops held and a ""Carbon-Kids"" program launched in local schools. New geological data has been gathered through targeted 2D seismic lines and a deep exploration well. Technical uncertainties have been catalogued and the next phase of pre-competitive data acquisition is now under planning with 3D seismic (recently acquired) and several wells targeted at reducing these uncertainties. This will increase confidence in the storage concept and the fundamental performance factors of capacity, injectivity and especially containment as the area does not appear to have a large regional seal. Geological studies have indicated that the Lesueur Sandstone can potentially store between 200-260 Mt of CO2 over 40 years with residual trapping being the principal containment mechanism. Very significant technical work has supported this development through a range of research projects launched under the auspices of the Australian National Low Emissions Coal Research and Development program (ANLEC R&D). The DMP is managing the SW Hub project in a stage-gated way with each investment phase progressing only when sufficient technical confidence justifies doing so. Industry, through a joint venture (JV), is aligning the capture programs of the industrial partners with feasibility studies and possible pipeline routes so that a comprehensive project work program can be tabled to acquire property rights under the new legislation. The SW Hub Project has faced (and continues to face) numerous technical, organisational, community and financial challenges. In overcoming these, a rich base of experience has been created. There are currently no CO2 storage projects (research, pilot or industrial) worldwide that focus on residual trapping mechanisms for primary containment and the SW Hub Project will potentially allow many more sites to be considered for storage as it develops and shares its research. The paper will elaborate on the importance of good processes, long term planning, extensive stakeholder management supported by a robust technical program as a viable blue-print for developing a green-field industrial scale CCS project.

2143786,Crop Residue Burning in India: Policy Challenges and Potential Solutions,"India, the second largest agro-based economy with year-round crop cultivation, generates a large amount of agricultural waste, including crop residues. In the absence of adequate sustainable management practices, approximately 92 seems a very small number of metric tons of crop waste is burned every year in India, causing excessive particulate matter emissions and air pollution. Crop residue burning has become a major environmental problem causing health issues as well as contributing to global warming. Composting, biochar production and mechanization are a few effective sustainable techniques that can help to curtail the issue while retaining the nutrients present in the crop residue in the soil. The government of India has attempted to curtail this problem, through numerous measures and campaigns designed to promote sustainable management methods such as converting crop residue into energy. However, the alarming rise of air pollution levels caused by crop residue burning in the city of Delhi and other northern areas in India observed in recent years, especially in and after the year of 2015, suggest that the issues is not yet under control. The solution to crop residue burning lies in the effective implementation of sustainable management practices with Government interventions and policies. This manuscript addresses the underlying technical as well as policy issues that has prevented India from achieving a long-lasting solution and also potential solutions that have been overlooked. However, effective implementation of these techniques also requires us to look at other socioeconomic aspects that had not been considered. This manuscript also discusses some of the policy considerations and functionality based on the analyses and current practices. The agricultural waste sector can benefit immensely from some of the examples from other waste sectors such as the municipal solid waste (MSW) and wastewater management where collection, segregation, recycling and disposal are institutionalized to secure an operational system. Active stakeholder involvement including education and empowerment of farmers along with technical solutions and product manufacturing can also assist tremendously. Even though the issue of crop residue burning touches many sectors, such as environment, agriculture, economy, social aspects, education, and energy, the past governmental efforts mainly revolved around agriculture and energy. This sectorial thinking is another barrier that needs to be broken. The government of India as well as governments of other developing countries can benefit from the emerging concept of nexus thinking in managing environmental resources. Nexus thinking promotes a higher-level integration and higher level of stakeholder involvement that goes beyond the disciplinary boundaries, providing a supporting platform to solve issues such as crop residue burning.",India; agricultural waste; crop residue; field residue; process residue; crop residue burning; biochar; composting; anaerobic digestion; biogas; policy challenges; nexus thinking,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7459182143211365,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
236904,The socio-political context for deploying carbon capture and storage in China and the U.S,"Together, the U.S. and China emit roughly 40% of world's greenhouse gas emissions, and these nations have stated their desire to reduce absolute emissions (U.S.) or reduce the carbon intensity of the economy (China). However, both countries are dependent on coal for a large portion of their energy needs, which is projected to continue over the next several decades. They also have large amounts of coal resources, coal-dependent electricity production, and in China's case, extensive use of coal in the industrial sector, making any shift from coal socio-politically difficult. Both nations could use carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to simultaneously decrease greenhouse gas emissions and continue the use of domestic coal resources; however, the socio-political context for CCS deployment differs substantially between the two countries and potentially makes large-scale CCS deployment challenging. Here, we examine and compare the political and institutional contexts shaping CCS policy and CCS deployment, both for initial pilot projects and for the creation of large-scale CCS technology deployment, and analyze how the socio-political context for CCS in China and the United States aligns with national climate, energy security, and economic priorities.

5338889,Undoing Equivalence: Rethinking Carbon Accounting for Just Carbon Removal,"Concerns are increasingly raised over the centrality of carbon removal in climate policy, particularly in the guise of “net-zero” targets. Most significantly perhaps, treating emissions and removals as equivalent obscures emission reductions, resulting in “mitigation deterrence.” Yet the conflation of emission reductions and removals is only one among several implicit equivalences in carbon removal accounting. Here, we examine three other forms—carbon, geographical, and temporal equivalence—and discuss their implications for climate justice and the environmental risks with carbon removal. We conclude that “undoing” these equivalences would further a just response to the climate crisis and tentatively explore what such undoing might look like in practice.

28791,2009 winter meeting: responsibility for germany's energy supply opening address,"Responsibility for energy supply concerns all stakeholders - politics, suppliers, and consumers - and requires unbiased analysis, realistic planning, and courageous commitment. We are facing enormous challenges: The financial crisis has arrived in the real economy and caused a deep recession. It is also against this background and that of energy prices rising again on a medium term, especially those of oil and natural gas, that the role of nuclear power in keeping prices down is indispensable. This makes life extension of German nuclear power plants an adjunct of a sustainable economic program, all the more so as it will not cost the taxpayer one cent. Climate protection - the operation of nuclear power plants in Germany annually saves emissions of approximately 150 million tons of CO2 - and security of supply also work in favor of continued operation of these plants. The important subject of final storage of radioactive waste needs to be pursued consistently. The Konrád mine marks a first step, but results must now be achieved also for high-level waste, for instance, by further exploration of the Gorleben salt dome.An Apollo Program for Energy is also required in designing the future energy mix. This program would include, for instance, research and development of technologies with higher efficiency, new ways to store electricity, technologies of CO2 separation and sequestration, and further development of renewable energies as well as fusion technology and advanced generation-IV reactors. Internationally, nuclear power is experiencing another upswing. With the exception of Germany, all other G8 countries, for instance, consider the use of nuclear power an absolutely meaningful enrichment of the energy mix. Definitive plans and applications for construction of new plants, respectively, in countries such as France, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Poland, Switzerland, and the United States of America underline the importance attached to nuclear power.",,Article,2009.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7446227073669434,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

4393088,Emergency deployment of direct air capture as a response to the climate crisis.,"Though highly motivated to slow the climate crisis, governments may struggle to impose costly polices on entrenched interest groups, resulting in a greater need for negative emissions. Here, we model wartime-like crash deployment of direct air capture (DAC) as a policy response to the climate crisis, calculating funding, net CO2 removal, and climate impacts. An emergency DAC program, with investment of 1.2-1.9% of global GDP annually, removes 2.2-2.3 GtCO2 yr-1 in 2050, 13-20 GtCO2 yr-1 in 2075, and 570-840 GtCO2 cumulatively over 2025-2100. Compared to a future in which policy efforts to control emissions follow current trends (SSP2-4.5), DAC substantially hastens the onset of net-zero CO2 emissions (to 2085-2095) and peak warming (to 2090-2095); yet warming still reaches 2.4-2.5°C in 2100. Such massive CO2 removals hinge on near-term investment to boost the future capacity for upscaling. DAC is most cost-effective when using electricity sources already available today: hydropower and natural gas with renewables; fully renewable systems are more expensive because their low load factors do not allow efficient amortization of capital-intensive DAC plants.",,"Journal Article; Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.744365930557251,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

776565,Additionality and permanence standards in California's Forest Offset Protocol: A review of project and program level implications,"A key component of California's cap-and-trade program is the use of carbon offsets as compliance instruments for reducing statewide GHG emissions. Under this program, offsets are tradable credits representing real, verifiable, quantifiable, enforceable, permanent, and additional reductions or removals of GHG emissions. This paper focuses on the permanence and additionality standards for offset credits as defined and operationalized in California's Compliance Offset Protocol for U.S. Forest Projects. Drawing on a review of the protocol, interviews, current offset projects, and existing literature, we discuss how additionality and permanence standards relate to project participation and overall program effectiveness. Specifically, we provide an overview of offset credits as compliance instruments in California's cap and-trade program, the timeline for a forest offset project, and the factors shaping participation in offset projects. We then discuss the implications of permanence and additionality at both the project and program levels. Largely consistent with previous work, we find that stringent standards for permanent and additional project activities can present barriers to participation, but also, that there may be a tradeoff between project quality and quantity (i.e. levels of participation) when considering overall program effectiveness. We summarize what this implies for California's forest offset program and provide suggestions for improvements in light of potential program diffusion and policy learning. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

1854425,Is There a Role for Subsurface Lease in Urban Development to Gain Community Support?,"Population growth, urbanization and technological developments may benefit from increased development of the subsurface. The possible uses of the subsurface however also result in fierce debates on societal needs, economic benefits and environmental impacts. Think for instance of siting land-based carbon capture and storage (CCS) facilities like in Barendrecht, the Netherlands. The public opinion was strongly against it and as a result the project was canceled. This paper proposes a subsurface lease model to gain community support and better take costs and benefits into account from different stakeholders' perspectives. Sustainable development of the subsurface requires cooperation in a well-defined framework that on the one hand enables stakeholders to make their own choices, but also includes mechanisms to fully account for the costs and benefits to society, providing them feedback in order to reach a social optimum. Looking at the three pillars of sustainability (planet, people, profit) the societal dimension may well be the most challenging one in projects relating for example, to large scale subsurface construction, siting projects for the extraction of shale gas or injection such as carbon capture and storage. The viability of a subsurface leasing model is discussed as a policy option to gain public support over and above the required stakeholder consultations and risk communication to create a situation in which citizens feel that they have a stake in the chosen solution with a fair distribution of the costs and benefits to society. Multiple use of space can strongly benefit from such an alignment of stakeholders with seemingly opposing interests. The distribution of ownership is an important factor here, which can hinder the decision-making process involved in the use of the urban environment. Full ownership is not always feasible, especially in case of the multiple use of space. Therefore in day to day practice communication, stakeholder acceptance and (perceived) risks also have shown to be important factors in governance and the ability to reach decisions regarding subsurface development effectively.",Subsurface lease; Sustainability framework; Willingness to pay (WTP); Willingness to accept (WTA),Proceedings Paper,2015.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7422710061073303,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
744155,Beyond the 2°C limit: Facing the economic and institutional challenges,"With very high risk of severe, widespread and irreversible impacts globally due to unabated anthropogenic climate change, we argue in this chapter that the 2°C limit can be justified by the synthesis of available scientific evidence as an application of the precautionary principle. In principle, the risks of mitigation differ fundamentally from the risks of climate change in terms of their nature, timescale, magnitude and persistence. Humankind has the technological means to solve the problem. However, the challenges of stringent mitigation action are enormous and have been increasing over the last decade because of the ongoing renaissance of coal, which does not allow for a decoupling of economic and population growth from emissions. Keeping a greater than 66% probability of staying below the 2°C limit, for example, would require current emission levels to be reduced by 40-70% by 2050, and emission levels of zero and below by the end of the 21st century. This requires a large-scale transformation in the way we produce and use energy, as well as how we use land. The most fundamental challenges are the oversupply of fossil fuels and the risks associated with negative emissions technologies, or high bioenergy deployment. A further delay in mitigation action substantially increases the difficulty of, and narrows the options for, this transformation. Delays are associated with a growing dependence on negative emissions technologies as well as higher mitigation costs in the long run. In the near term, a fundamental departure from the business-as-usual development is required. Therefore, triggering short-term climate policy action is instrumental for any reasonable long-term climate goal. While the institutional challenges are tantamount, there are multiple rationales for pricing carbon and introducing complementary policies. © 2015, Centre for Economic Policy Research.

However, for China to meet the energy security and climate change objectives set out in its 12th Five-Year Plan it will be reliant on the widespread commercial deployment of two key technologies; hydraulic fracturing combined with horizontal drilling for shale gas, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) for coal. China is moving to acquire these technologies through technology transfer and diffusion from the US, but progress has been slow, and neither is currently available in China on a commercial scale. Drawing on interviews in the US and China, this article argues that China's expectation of technology from the US may well be disappointed because of factors unique to the US institutional environment that have made the development of fracking technology possible and hinder the development of CCS technology at a commercial scale.Policy relevanceIf China is to meet the energy security and climate change objectives set out in its 12th Five-Year Plan it will be reliant on the widespread commercial deployment of fracking and clean coal technologies. While China expects to acquire these technologies via technology transfer and diffusion from the US, progress has been slow. Because of factors unique to the US institutional environment the availability of both technologies on a commercial scale in China is unlikely in the coming years.

241562,Trojan horse or horn of plenty? Reflections on allowing CCS in the CDM,"The discussion around allowing CO2 capture and geological storage (CCS) into the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) is important, as the CDM is currently the only structural incentive for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the developing world. Without the potential incentives given by the CDM, CCS in developing countries will only take place sporadically in niche sectors. The debate around CCS in the CDM has developed into a highly polarised discussion, with a deep divide between proponents and opponents and no view on reconciliation between the various perspectives. Environmental organisations and several developing-country parties in the climate negotiations are increasingly vehemently opposed against CCS in the CDM, and industrialised countries, several large fossil-fuel-dependent developing countries and industry view CCS as a natural option under the CDM, provided some surmountable technical and procedural barriers are taken care of. This paper argues that the efforts of those trying to bring the discussion to a close by solving technical and procedural issues around CCS in the CDM will not lead to agreement because of underlying convictions of all stakeholders. Six convictions are identified and discussed. Based on the discussion of the convictions of both opponents and proponents, research needs and a potential negotiation package are suggested. The research needs are primarily in the field of the CDM market impacts of CCS, the issue of enhanced oil emission accounting, and sustainable development aspects, and particularly whether developing countries could actually benefit from technological leadership in the field of CCS, or whether they will be worse off. Devoting attention to the identified convictions could provide information for a more acceptable negotiation package on CCS in the CDM. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

577217,Ethics and geoengineering: reviewing the moral issues raised by solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal,"After two decades of failure by the international community to respond adequately to the threat of global climate change, discussions of the possibility of geoengineering a cooler climate have recently proliferated. Alongside the considerable optimism that these technologies have generated, there has also been wide acknowledgement of significant ethical concerns. Ethicists, social scientists, and experts in governance have begun the work of addressing these concerns. The plethora of ethical issues raised by geoengineering creates challenges for those who wish to survey them. The issues are here separated out according to the temporal spaces in which they first arise. Some crop up when merely contemplating the prospect of geoengineering. Others appear as research gets underway. Another set of issues attend the actual implementation of the technologies. A further set occurs when planning for the cessation of climate engineering. Two cautions about this organizational schema are in order. First, even if the issues first arise in the temporal spaces identified, they do not stay completely contained within them. A good reason to object to the prospect of geoengineering, for example, will likely remain a good reason to object to its implementation. Second, the ethical concerns intensify or weaken depending on the technology under consideration. The wide range of geoengineering technologies currently being discussed makes it prudent that each technique should be evaluated individually for its ethical merit.

Adjustments along the land use and input intensity margins are represented within a regionalized optimization model of California crop production calibrated to economic and agronomic information. Second-best policies relying on spatially aggregated GHG emission factors lead to small abatement efficiency losses, while policies targeting a single GHG lead to moderate losses. In contrast, policies targeting a single input entail large abatement efficiency losses, which nonetheless can be reduced by combining instruments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

5236631,Managing the risks of missing international climate targets,"The Paris targets are based on assumptions that a global temperature increase of 1.5 degrees C-2 degrees C above preindustrial levels will be safe, and that the climate can be stabilized at these higher temperatures. However, global average temperatures are already measurably impacting the Earth's systems at 1.2 degrees C above preindustrial levels. Many human and environmental systems cannot adapt to higher temperatures, which may exceed critical tipping points in physical climate and ecological systems. Compounding these risks is the likelihood that the international 2 degrees C limit will be overshot due to political obstacles and systemic inertia from existing greenhouse gases, warming oceans, and the decades required to replace existing infrastructure. Moreover, the Earth energy imbalance may have to be reduced to approximately zero to stabilize the global climate (i.e., CO2 concentrations lowered to around 350 ppm.) Most IPCC mitigation scenarios assume that climate targets will be temporarily overshot, and require large-scale carbon dioxide removal [CDR] to subsequently lower temperatures. However, many CDR methods may not be politically and/or technologically feasible, and they will act too slowly to prevent dangerous overshoot. These issues raise serious doubts about the ability of current mitigation polices to ensure safe outcomes. They also indicate the need to investigate whether rapid climate cooling measures may be required to reduce the risks associated with high temperatures during the long time it will take to decarbonize the global economy and stabilize the climate. Given the uncertainty of future mitigation success, and the potentially existential costs of failure, there is now an urgent need to examine whether or not current efforts are credible, and if not, what mitigation measures will be required to prevent dangerous overshoot and ensure a safe, stable climate. In order to develop a feasible mitigation strategy, it will be necessary to prioritize research both on climate overshoot risks, and on the relative effectiveness, risks, costs and timelines of potential mitigation and adaptation approaches. Since large scale climate interventions will be needed to prevent dangerous global warming, all plausible options need to be investigated, including carbon dioxide removal methods and technologies for rapidly cooling global temperatures. This research is a prerequisite for evaluating the comparative benefits, costs and risks of using, or not using, various forms of mitigation and adaptation, and then developing a realistic overshoot risk management plan.",Climate risk management; Paris agreement; Overshoot; Tipping points; Climate interventions,Short Survey,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7395380735397339,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
316873,The role of forests in carbon capture and climate change,"Widespread concern about global climate change has led to agreements to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) and, under certain circumstances, to count additional carbon absorbed in soils and vegetation as part of the emissions reductions. Forests are a significant part of the global carbon cycle. However, little information exists on the processes and diverse rates of soil carbon change. How to account for changes in forest carbon has been contentious. Land use changes - especially afforestation and deforestation - can have major impacts on carbon storage. In the 110th Congress, several proposals have been introduced that would either mandate or authorize a cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This book explains the role of forests in carbon capture and the steps being taken by Congress to attempt to slow down the effects of climate change caused by the previously under-regulated emissions of carbon dioxide.

5204187,Different This Time? The Prospects of CCS in the Netherlands in the 2020s,"Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) has been recognized as an important means of mitigating global climate change, but apart from several pilots, it has not yet been successfully implemented on the large scale needed to live up to the expectations as a mitigation method. In Netherlands, the option of CCS has been the subject of debate for a long time, as three unsuccessful projects - two onshore in Barendrecht and the Northern regions, and one offshore near the Port of Rotterdam - demonstrate. Nevertheless, CCS has been accorded an important place in the current Dutch climate policies, being expected to contribute up to 7 Megaton of CO2 reduction. This is reflected in a fresh crop of CCS project plans. For the most, these plans have a long way to go from the drawing board to actual operations due to the technical, economic, legal and societal challenges ahead. In this article we review the status and possibilities of CCS in Netherlands based on an analysis of existing literature in the relevant disciplines. First, a brief overview of the technology options for carbon capture and storage or utilization is given. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the governmental support for CCS, given the vital role that fit-for-purpose legal frameworks and policy instruments will play in CCS deployment. Technical, legal and policy uncertainties translates into factors inhibiting CCS investment and so the paper then presents a CCS investment project to illustrate how such risks affect the business case for CCS. Finally, bearing in mind that societal acceptance has proved to be a major barrier for CCS, both in Netherlands and elsewhere, the conditions that enhance public acceptance of CCS are examined. Our work shows that while CCS is technically a straightforward proposition, its deployment has historically been hindered by the lack of a sound business case and a compelling and stable socio-technical narrative. The main argument in favor of CCS today is that it offers a transition pathway for rapidly and massively reducing CO2 emissions beyond what could be accomplished by alternative methods like electrification and renewable fuels in near future. The introduction of new financial instruments, increased government support and an improvement in social engagement appear to have enhanced the prospects of CCS in Netherlands, but we feel it is premature to assume that this time everything is different.",carbon capture and storage (CCS); carbon capture and utilization (CCU); sustainability; uncertainties analysis; climate action plan 2030+,Review,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7379119992256165,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
4385919,Large-Scale Carbon Dioxide Removal: The Problem of Phasedown,"Most scenarios that achieve present climate targets of limiting global heating to 1.5 degrees-2.0 degrees C rely on large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to drive net emissions negative after mid-century. Scenarios that overshoot and return to a future temperature target, or that aim to restore some prior climate, require CDR to be rapidly deployed, operated for a century or so, then greatly reduced or phased out. This need for future phasedown presents challenges to near-term policies that have been underexamined. A CDR enterprise of climate-relevant scale will require financial flows of billions to trillions of dollars per year. The enterprise and supporting policies will create risks of lock-in via mobilized actors whose interests favor continuance as well as other mechanisms. The future phasedown need implies suggestive guidance for near-term decisions about removal methods and design of associated policy and business environments. First, variation among methods' scale constraints and cost structures suggests a rough ordering of methods by severity of future phasedown challenges. Second, of the three potential means to motivate removals-profitable products incorporating removed carbon, extended emissions-pricing policies, or public procurement contracts-public procurement appears to present the fewest roadblocks to future phasedown.",,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.737840473651886,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

214092,Payment for environmental services: Interactions with property rights and collective action,"Global climate change and environmental degradation highlight the need for institutions of sustainability. In particular, there is increased interest in the potential of payments for environmental services (PES) to improve incentives for sustainable land management. Although smallholder land users can be efficient producers of environmental services of value to larger communities and societies, experience shows that the international and national institutions that govern PES are often designed in ways that entail transaction costs that cannot be feasibly met by individual smallholders. This chapter presents a conceptual framework to examine the inter-linkages between property rights, collective action, payment for environmental services, and the welfare of smallholder land users, examining how these play out in the contexts of carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and watershed functions. Greater consideration of the linkages between PES and other rural institutions can lead to more equitable outcomes, particularly by (1) suggesting how collective action can be used to overcome transaction costs and barriers to participation by smallholders and (2) identifying mechanisms through which managers of small private parcels or areas of common property can be rewarded for environmental stewardship through PES. © 2009 Springer Netherlands.",,CHAP,2009.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7374424338340759,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The fair share quota is assessed as a maximum of c. 391 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2), equal to 83 tonnes of carbon dioxide (tCO2) per capita, from 2015, based on a precautionary estimate of the global carbon budget (GCB) and specific interpretation of global equity. Given Ireland’s high current CO2 per capita emission rate, this would correspond to sustained year-on-year reductions in nett annual CO2 emissions of over − 11% per year (beginning as of 2016). By contrast, the CO2 mitigation target indicated in the National Policy Position corresponds to nett annual reduction rates in the range of only −4.7% per year (low ambition) up to a maximum of − 8.3% per year (high ambition), and projections based on current and immediately planned mitigation measures indicate the possibility, instead, of sustained increases in emissions at a rate of the order of + 0.7% per year. Accordingly, there is a large gap between Paris-aligned ambition and current political and policy reality on the ground, with a significant risk of early emergence of “CO2 debt” and tacit reliance on rapid deployment of currently speculative (at a relevant scale and feasible cost) negative CO2 emission technologies to actively remove CO2 from the atmosphere. While the detailed policy situation will clearly differ from country to country, we suggest that this methodology, and its CO2debt framing, may be usefully applied in other individual countries or regions. We recommend that such framing be incorporated explicitly into a global mitigation strategy via the statements of nationally determined contributions required to be submitted and updated by all parties under the Paris Agreement processes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7364760637283325,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
486665,"Designing, testing and implementing a trial dryland salinity credit trade scheme","This article describes implementation and outcomes of a credit trading trial focussed on dryland salinity in Victoria, Australia. in lieu of extant specified property rights, participants were invited to agree to obligations to provide groundwater recharge credits in exchange for pecuniary compensation. Participants were able to meet their obligations to supply groundwater recharge credits through land management actions resulting in monitored outcomes consistent with contractual obligations to reduce recharge. Alternatively, those in deficit were provided the option to obtain sufficient credits through market Exchange. Surplus transferable recharge credits were produced by those participants who exceeded their own contractual obligations through improved land management. The paper describes the process of contract design and implementation. The trial involved a design and testing phase and an on-ground implementation phase. We describe composite methodologies deployed in the design and testing of alternative policy instruments and institutional arrangements, conducted prior to implementation. These involved community consultation, an attitudinal and behavioural survey, experimental economics and the development of a transparent and credible monitoring protocol. The conclusions drawn as a result of this analysis provided an empirical basis to implement the on-ground trial phase. Results of on-ground implementation are described. Finally, the methods and results of a Benefit Cost Analysis (BCA) of the on-ground trial implementation are outlined. The BCA accounted for salinity damage reduction, forgone river flow, carbon sequestration, production benefits and costs. The result of BCA was an estimated net benefit.

469367,"Promising synergies to address water, sequestration, legal, and public acceptance issues associated with large-scale implementation of CO2 sequestration","Stabilization of CO2 atmospheric concentrations requires practical strategies to address the challenges posed by the continued use of coal for baseload-electricity production. Over the next two decades, CO2 capture and sequestration (CCS) demonstration projects would need to increase several orders of magnitude across the globe in both size and scale. This task has several potential barriers which will have to be accounted for. These barriers include those that have been known for a number of years including safety of subsurface sequestration, pore-space competition with emerging activities like shale gas production, legal and regulatory frameworks, and public acceptance and technical communication. In addition water management is a new challenge that should be actively and carefully considered across all CCS operations. A review of the new insights gained on these previously and newly identified challenges, since the IPCC special report on CCS, is presented in this paper. While somewhat daunting in scope, some of these challenges can be addressed more easily by recognizing the potential advantageous synergies that can be exploited when these challenges are dealt with in combination. For example, active management of water resources, including brine in deep subsurface formations, can provide the additional cooling-water required by the CO2 capture retrofitting process while simultaneously reducing sequestration leakage risk and furthering efforts toward public acceptance. This comprehensive assessment indicates that water, sequestration, legal, and public acceptance challenges ought to be researched individually, but must also be examined collectively to exploit the promising synergies identified herein. Exploitation of these synergies provides the best possibilities for successful large-scale implementation of CCS.",CO2 capture and sequestration; Implementation barriers; Synergies; Legal and regulatory; Public acceptance; Water management; Brine production; Pressure management; Pore space competition; Area of review; Risk mitigation,Review,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7348781228065491,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
2568461,Learning from the Climate Change Debate to Avoid Polarisation on Negative Emissions,"This paper identifies critical lessons from the climate change experience to guide how communications and engagement on negative emissions can be conducted to encourage functional public and policy discourse. Negative emissions technologies present a significant opportunity for limiting climate change, and are likely to be necessary to keep warming below 2 degrees C. While the concept of negative emissions is still in its infancy, there is evidence of nascent polarization, and a lack of nuance in discussion of individual technologies. We argue that if negative emissions technologies are to be implemented effectively and sustainably, an effective governance regime is needed; built on functional societal discourse and avoiding the ideological baggage of the broader climate change debate or the controversies concerning geoengineering. At its core, our argument is to avoid the ideological bundling of negative emissions; this can be pursued directly and via careful selection of communication frames and the use of non-partisan, trusted messengers. Whether these lessons are heeded may determine if negative emissions are governed proactively, or are distorted politically, misused and delayed.",Framing; ideology; geoengineering; greenhouse gas removal; climate engineering,Article,2020.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.7345848083496094,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1738149,Carbon capture and storage in context: the importance of state policy and discourse in deploying emerging energy technologies,"As a technology that may involve new risks, large-scale infrastructure, and significant government involvement, carbon capture and storage (CCS) faces a wide variety of deployment challenges. Because energy policy in the U.S is negotiated at the state level, it is important to evaluate what might influence CCS related decisions in the U.S. at that level. This paper presents a detailed analysis of how deployment discussions and decisions regarding CCS are negotiated within Texas, Minnesota, and Massachusetts. These states were chosen based upon their current involvement in CCS research (high, medium, low), potential for deploying CCS ( direct, indirect, or absent), and regulation (restructured, regulated). We explore nuances within the policy debates and public discourse surrounding CCS in these three states through the use of legislative and policy analysis, interviews with stakeholders, and media analysis. Using information generated from legislative dockets and state-level newspaper coverage we construct a template of CCS discussions, framing, and policy creation within each study state.

Many countries now face the challenge to find cost-effective ways to deploy low-carbon technologies in order to meet commitments to the Paris Agreement. Process systems engineering (PSE) can play an essential role in supporting high-level policy decisions to help mitigate climate change. Within PSE, carbon-constrained planning will become increasingly critical for policy-making on provision of sustainable energy in electricity generation as well as other economic sectors. There are existing carbon-constrained planning tools but these often consider energy issues from limited perspectives at specific scales. In this perspective paper, we argue for a Process-to-Policy framework that centres on carbon-constrained planning which includes various stakeholders at various scales for developing strategies to address global warming. There is an urgent need for research on the development of such tools at multiple scales to effectively allocate countermeasures such as negative emission technologies. We also discuss potential extensions for carbon-constrained planning in conjunction with other established tools.

1838495,Analysing uncertainties for CCS: from historical analogues to future deployment pathways in the UK,"Whilst carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies are now in the demonstration phase, they are still characterised by a range of technical, economic, policy, social and legal uncertainties. This paper presents the results of an interdisciplinary research project funded by the UK Energy Research Centre (UKERC). The aim of the project was to analyse the main uncertainties facing potential investors in CCS and policy makers wishing to support these technologies through demonstration to commercial deployment. The paper presents a framework for the analysis of these uncertainties, and applies this framework to nine analogue case studies of CCS. These case studies have focused on historical developments in technologies and/or policy frameworks where one or more of these uncertainties has been prominent and have, in most cases, been partly resolved. The paper also shows applies the insights from these historical case studies to develop three potential pathways for CCS deployment in the UK over the period to 2030. Finally, the paper concludes with sonic implications for CCS policies and strategies. (C) 2013 The Authors.

555692,"Consequences of climate change for European agricultural productivity, land use and policy","This paper reviews the knowledge on effects of climate change on agricultural productivity in Europe and the consequences for policy and research. Warming is expected to lead to a northward expansion of suitable cropping areas and a reduction of the growing period of determinate crops (e.g. cereals), but an increase for indeterminate crops (e.g. root crops). Increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations will directly enhance plant productivity and also increase resource use efficiencies. In northern areas climate change may produce positive effects on agriculture through introduction of new crop species and varieties, higher crop production and expansion of suitable areas for crop cultivation. Disadvantages may be an increase in the need for plant protection, the risk of nutrient leaching and the turnover of soil organic matter. In southern areas the disadvantages will predominate. The possible increase in water shortage and extreme weather events may cause lower harvestable yields, higher yield variability and a reduction in suitable areas for traditional crops. These effects may reinforce the current trends of intensification of agriculture in northern and western Europe and extensification in the Mediterranean and southeastern parts of Europe. Policy will have to support the adaptation of European agriculture to climate change by encouraging the flexibility of land use, crop production, farming systems etc. In doing so, it is necessary to consider the multifunctional role of agriculture, and to strike a variable balance between economic, environmental and social functions in different European regions. Policy will also need to be concerned with agricultural strategies to mitigate climate change through a reduction in emissions of methane and nitrous oxide, an increase in carbon sequestration in agricultural soils and the growing of energy crops to substitute fossil energy use. The policies to support adaptation and mitigation to climate change will need to be linked closely to the development of agri-environmental schemes in the European Union Common Agricultural Policy. Research will have further to deal with the effect on secondary factors of agricultural production, on the quality of crop and animal production, of changes in frequency of isolated and extreme weather events on agricultural production, and the interaction with the surrounding natural ecosystems. There is also a need to study combined effects of adaptation and mitigation strategies, and include assessments of the consequences on current efforts in agricultural policy to develop a sustainable agriculture that also preserves environmental and social values in the rural society.

Without HASS contributions, too narrow a range of perspectives, futures and issues will be considered, undermining or overpromising the prospects for the responsible development of GGR (and threatening worse side-effects), and limiting our understanding of why and how policy demands GGR solutions in the first place.

5292369,"A Critical Review of the IUCN UK Peatland Programme's ""Burning and Peatlands"" Position Statement","Despite substantial contrary evidence, there has been a growing tendency to present prescribed vegetation burning as a management practice that is always damaging to peatland ecosystems in the UK. This is exemplified by the ""Burning and Peatlands"" position statement published by the International Union for Conservation of Nature UK Peatland Programme. Indeed, while we strongly agree with several of the statements made within this position statement, it also contains a series of unverified assertions and misleading arguments that seemingly serve to simplify the narrative and paint prescribed burning as a wholly damaging peatland management tool. Given that this position statement is published by one of the UK's most prominent peatland conservation organisations, it is likely to be consulted when debating upland land use policy. Therefore, for the benefit of policymakers, we provide a point-by-point critical review of the ""Burning and Peatlands"" position statement.

5343999,Saving Mangrove Forest Extinction in Urban Areas: Will Government Interventions Help?,"The local government failure (city government level) to operationalize policies and accelerate the public interest in mangrove restoration into concrete activities contributes to the inability to save mangrove forests from extinction. As a result, a solution related to intervention is required as policy implementation design and sustainability, namely how the city government can translate and operationalize various national and provincial level policies in appropriate local (city) policies, build networking among stakeholders, and build the participation of non-government actors, including the community. The study employed a qualitative approach and an interviewing technique with nine informants from government and non-government organizations involved in policy implementation performance and sustainability. Data collection was carried out by in-depth interviews and analyzed through interactive methods. This study concluded that future implementation designs must incorporate policies into spatial plans for regional development and gradually institutionalize them, beginning with the establishment of authorities, the arrangement of hierarchies, agreed-upon limits, and procedures. At the management level, it is necessary to strengthen the relationship between stakeholders. This can help mitigate the conflict and foster collaboration. Sustaining the implementation performance in the future will require the involvement and participation of non-government stakeholders, including the community, and the adoption of best practices at the local community level. Both will be shared lessons between the government and the community and the key to the sustainability of policy implementation. © 2022 WITPress.

Two cases were considered: i) straight biochar use and ii) biochar in combination with compost (COMBI: 20% biochar and 80% compost mass fraction), at application rates of 5 and 10 Mg ha(-1) respectively. Based on realistic estimations of achievable crop-yield performances by biochar and COMBI addition to dry soils, the effect of current policies on the economic viability of biochar deployment and farmers' income has been investigated. Using a cost-model we identified the required levels of support, in the form of (i) area subsidies for crop cultivation, (ii) tradable carbon certificates (credits), and (iii) REDII-compliant biofuel support for Aviation and Maritime, so to make biochar and sunflower cultivation in EU MED dry marginal lands competitive for sustainable crop-based biofuels. Results show that, by employing existing policy instruments, sufficient income can be generated for famers to recover marginal land, sequester large amount of carbon by BECCS at costs (similar to 82 (sic) Mg-1 of CO2) falling at or below the typical range of CCS measures, as well as offer additional environmental and socio-economic positive benefits. The combination of currently operational economic mechanisms from the Common Agricultural Policy, the Climate Policy, and the Renewable Energy Directive II can: i) maintain domestic farming activities, ii) support the implementation of biochar projects at local level, iii) contribute to achieve EU and national biofuel targets without generating ILUC impacts and iv) achieve unprecedent potential for carbon sequestration.

Still, peatland degradation and conversion and even land fires continue to occur in Riau. The role of an effective and synergistic institutional network is essential and strategic for its existence. This paper analyzes the dominant role of key institutions in the arena of action for the peat ecosystem restoration plan and formulates a model of the institutional network. The method used is applying systematic and iterative graphic theory with institutional analysis tools, namely ISM or Interpretative Structure Modeling. The study results obtained three classifications of peat ecosystem restoration institutional networks based on critical institutions' main tasks and functions: institutional coordination, cooperation, and assistance/guidance programs. The conclusion drawn is that based on the institutional network model, it is known that cooperative institutions facilitate the maturation of the concept of peat restoration against the jointly planned program. The policy implication is strengthening the synergy of multi-stakeholder institutions formed as a critical factor in the management of sustainable peat restoration. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Conference Paper,2022.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.7296847701072693,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

4917139,Linking climate science and climate action: An equitable way to raise climate finance,"Energy for sustainable development requires replacing fossil fuel use by renewables. Such substitution is the kingpin of climate action. As per IPCC AR6 WG I latest report ""limiting human-induced global warming requires limiting cumulative CO2 emissions"" and ""every tonne of CO2 emissions adds to global warming"". In other words, climate action should focus on cumulative emissions and not on annual emissions. We need to shift the discourse from annual emissions to cumulated emissions. For example, in the Paris Agreement instead of the final level of emissions in 2030 as goals emphasis should have been on the cumulated emissions of the pathways till 2030. Responsibility for finance needs to be in that proportion. Moreover, an annual fee of even US$1 per ton from all countries big and small on their cumulated emissions from 1990 onwards incentivises them to reduce and postpone their emissions. Such a fee can currently raise annually at least US$ 733 billion for climate finance. Moreover, focusing on annual emissions can lead to a false sense of comfort that climate change is under control, whereas warming will continue even after net-zero is attained.

822949,A review of technology and policy deep decarbonization pathway options for making energy-intensive industry production consistent with the Paris Agreement,"The production of commodities by energy-intensive industry is responsible for 1/3 of annual global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The climate goal of the Paris Agreement, to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C, requires global GHG emissions reach net-zero and probably negative by 2055-2080. Given the average economic lifetime of industrial facilities is 20 years or more, this indicates all new investment must be net-zero emitting by 2035-2060 or be compensated by negative emissions to guarantee GHG-neutrality. We argue, based on a sample portfolio of emerging and near commercial technologies for each sector (largely based on zero carbon electricity & heat sources, biomass and carbon capture, and catalogued in an accompanying database), that reducing energy intensive industrial GHG emissions to Paris Agreement compatible levels may not only be technically possible, but can be achieved with sufficient prioritization and policy effort. We then review policy options to drive innovation and investment in these technologies. From this we synthesize a preliminary integrated strategy for a managed transition with minimum stranded assets, unemployment, and social trauma that recognizes the competitive and globally traded nature of commodity production. The strategy includes: an initial policy commitment followed by a national and sectoral stakeholder driven pathway process to build commitment and identify opportunities based on local zero carbon resources; penetration of near-commercial technologies through increasing valuation of GHG material intensity through GHG pricing or tradable performance based regulations with protection for competitiveness and against carbon leakage; research and demand support for the output of pilot plants, including some combination of guaranteed above-market prices that decline with output and an increasing requirement for low carbon Inputs in government procurement; and finally, key supporting institutions.

However, the many suggested means of limiting emissions rates have led to few actual changes in policy or behavior. This disconnection can be attributed in part to the difficulty of convening groups of stakeholders with diverse values, the polarizing nature of current political systems, poor communication across disciplines, and a lack of clear, usable information about emission mitigation strategies. Here, electronically facilitated ethical deliberation, a method of determining courses of action on common goals by collaborative discussion, is used to evaluate Pacala and Socolow's climate change stabilization strategies based on economic, technological, social, and ecological impacts across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. Few previous analyses of climate mitigation strategies include all of these factors; rather, short-term technological feasibility studies and economic cost-benefit analyses predominate. After accounting for tradeoffs among disparate criteria, strategies involving end-user efficiency (e.g., efficient buildings and vehicles), wind, and solar power rank highest, while carbon capture and storage, hydrogen fuel cells, and biofuels options rank lowest. This electronically facilitated deliberation method offers an alternative to oppositional debate or cost-benefit analysis for assessing strategies where both quantitative and qualitative factors are important, information from disparate disciplines is relevant, and stakeholders are geographically dispersed.",,Article,2010.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7260934114456177,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
481412,Carbon dioxide (CO2) pipelines for carbon sequestration: Emerging policy issues,"Congress is examining potential approaches to reducing manmade contributions to global warming from U.S. sources. One approach is carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) — capturing CO2 at its source (e.g., a power plant) and storing it indefinitely (e.g., underground) to avoid its release to the atmosphere. A common requirement among the various techniques for CCS is a dedicated pipeline network for transporting CO2 from capture sites to storage sites. In the 110th Congress, there has been considerable debate on the capture and sequestration aspects of carbon sequestration, while there has been relatively less focus on transportation. Nonetheless, there is increasing understanding in Congress that a national CCS program could require the construction of a substantial network of interstate CO2 pipelines. S. 2144 and S. 2191 would require the Secretary of Energy to study the feasibility of constructing and operating such a network of pipelines. S. 2323 would require carbon sequestration projects to evaluate the most cost-efficient ways to integrate CO2 sequestration, capture, and transportation. S. 2149 would allow seven-year accelerated depreciation for qualifying CO2 pipelines. P.L. 110-140, signed by President Bush on December 19, 2007, requires the Secretary of the Interior to recommend legislation to clarify the issuance of CO2 pipeline rights-of-way on public land. That CCS and related legislation have been more focused on the capture and storage of CO2 than on its transportation, reflects a perception that transporting CO2 via pipelines does not present a significant barrier to implementing large-scale CCS. Notwithstanding this perception, and even though regional CO2 pipeline networks already operate in the United States for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), developing a more expansive national CO2 pipeline network for CCS could pose numerous new regulatory and economic challenges. There are important unanswered questions about pipeline network requirements, economic regulation, utility cost recovery, regulatory classification of CO2 itself, and pipeline safety. Furthermore, because CO2 pipelines for EOR are already in use today, policy decisions affecting CO2 pipelines take on an urgency that is, perhaps, unrecognized by many. Federal classification of CO2 as both a commodity (by the Bureau of Land Management) and as a pollutant (by the Environmental Protection Agency) could potentially create an immediate conflict which may need to be addressed not only for the sake of future CCS implementation, but also to ensure consistency of future CCS with CO2 pipeline operations today. In addition to these issues, Congress may examine how CO2 pipelines fit into the nation’s overall strategies for energy supply and environmental protection. If policy makers encourage continued consumption of fossil fuels under CCS, then the need to foster the other energy options may be diminished — and vice versa. Thus decisions about CO2 pipeline infrastructure could have consequences for a broader array of energy and environmental policies. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

261623,"An Economic Perspective on Technological Transitions Related to Energy and Climate Change, with a Case Study of the UK","The paper discusses the concept of technological transitions and theories of how they might come about. It then relates this concept to current policy concerns about climate change and energy and presents research results about what a low-carbon energy system might look like and how it could be achieved. It then briefly explores the policy implications and possible macro-economic costs of moving to a low-carbon energy system. Technological transitions are relevant. to climate change and energy because the energy system is a major technological system in society, and to reduce its carbon emissions dramatically, as is required if dangerous anthropogenic climate change is to be avoided; will require a full technological transition. There are many low-carbon technologies with the potential for large-scale deployment. Simulations suggest that the decarbonisation of the electricity system, involving any or all of carbon capture and storage, nuclear power and renewables, with increasing use of electricity in the residential and transport sectors, will be required. There may also be a role for bioenergy and hydrogen. In all cases strong public policies will be required to achieve large cuts in carbon emissions, involving carbon pricing, technology support and removing barriers to lifestyle and behaviour changes. Currently, while many different policies have been implemented, they have not been strongly enough applied to achieve sustained emissions reduction. Most models suggest that the macroeconomic costs of substantial cuts in carbon emissions are relatively small (1-4% GDP by 2050) compared to the costs of unabated climate change. However, the political costs of implementing the required policies may mean that politicians are unable in practice to prevent runaway climate change.",,Article,2010.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7256602644920349,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Well-designed incentives can encourage landholder adoption of reforestation within production landscapes, while delivering social, economic and biodiversity co-benefits. Here, I draw on lessons from extensive research on barriers and enablers to landholder adoption of tree planting, the growing literature highlighting the potential benefits of assisted natural regeneration (ANR) for large-scale reforestation, and experiences from a voluntary land-based carbon abatement ('carbon farming') program implemented in Australia since 2012, where tree planting and ANR comprise several approved reforestation methods. Carbon farming projects to date have primarily adopted the ANR methods, yet program outcomes have been undermined by increased deforestation elsewhere in Australia. Policy uncertainty, the provision of co-benefits and the availability of trusted information are key factors influencing landholder adoption. Incentives for reforestation must be underpinned by a coherent and complementary policy mix which facilitates long-term participation and genuine environmental outcomes.",,Review,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7253810167312622,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This technology, known as carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), could provide deep emission cuts, particularly from coal power generation, on a worldwide basis. In order to widely deploy this technology, future CCS operators must be able to access millions of acres of deep subsurface ""pore space"" roughly a kilometer below the earth's surface to sequester the CO2 for hundreds to thousands of years. This Article explores questions relating to ownership of subsurface pore space, physical takings, regulatory takings, and just compensation that will necessarily accompany the implementation of CCS in the United States.

1839565,CO2 capture and storage: A geopolitical issue,"Hitherto, no large-scale power plant, fully integrated with CCS, including monitoring and verification, has become operational. It may still take years until this happens on a bona-fide basis. The most plausible reasons are high cost, commercial uncertainty, lack of a foreseeable regulatory framework, problems pertaining to bankability, and, last but not least, liability for the stored CO2. In this paper, attention is paid to the necessity of CCS and to its relative importance in a geopolitical context.

624978,Making carbon dioxide sequestration feasible: Toward federal regulation of CO2 sequestration pipelines,"As the United States moves closer to a national climate change policy, it will have to focus on a variety of factors affecting the manner in which the country moves toward a future with a substantially lower carbon footprint. In addition to encouraging renewable energy, smart grid, clean fuels and other technologies, the United States will need to make substantial infrastructure investments in a variety of industries. Among the significant contributors to the current carbon footprint in the United States is the use of coal as a major fuel for the generation of electricity. One of the most important technologies that the United States can employ to reduce its carbon footprint is to sequester the carbon dioxide (""CO2"") from coal-fired power plants. This article focuses on the legal and policy issues surrounding a critical piece of the necessary sequestration infrastructure: CO2 pipelines that will carry CO2 from where it is removed from fuel or waste gas streams to where it will be sequestered. Ultimately, this article recommends developing a federally regulated CO2 pipeline program to foster the implementation of carbon sequestration technology. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

602750,"Carbon sequestration, economic policies and growth","We present a model of endogenous growth in which the use of a non-renewable resource in production yields CO2 emissions whose accumulated stock negatively affects welfare. A CCS technology enables, via some effort, a partial reduction of these emissions. We characterize the social optimum and how the availability of CCS technology affects it, and study the trajectories of the decentralized economy. We then analyze economic policies. We first derive the expression of the Pigovian carbon tax and we give a full interpretation of its level, which is unique. We then study the impacts of three different second-best policies: a carbon tax, a subsidy to sequestered carbon, and a subsidy to labor in CCS. While all three tools foster CCS activity they generally have contrasting effects on resource extraction, carbon emissions, output and consumption. The carbon tax postpones resource extraction whereas the two subsidies accelerate it. Although the tax decreases short-term carbon emissions, the two subsidies can increase them, thus yielding a green paradox. The tax has a negative impact on the levels of output and consumption in the short-term, unlike the subsidies. The tax generally fosters growth whereas the subsidies reduce it; however, when the weight of the CCS sector in the economy is high, these impacts can be reversed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

4656918,Achieving the climate goal with intergovernmental transfers to the forestry sector: insights from the Indian experience,"Forests play an important role in both mitigation and adaptation to climate change. India is amongst a select group of countries that have experimented with intergovernmental fiscal transfers to support forest conservation. Well-designed transfers have important implications for the achievement of national and international commitments for forest conservation, the well-being of communities and climate mitigation. A substantial amount, USD 51 billion was allocated for devolution from the Union (Government of India) to the subnational (state) governments against the forest cover criteria for the period 2015–2019. Evidence indicates that this substantial devolution did not guarantee fund flows to the forestry sector nor result in an appreciable increase in conservation outcomes in states that benefited the most from the transfers. We conduct an in-depth empirical analysis which demonstrates that the design of the transfer is crucial in determining outcomes. Findings indicate that conservation and afforestation outcomes are likely to be better when the ecological values, the bulk of which are carbon values, are incorporated upfront in financial allocation decisions. Indirectly incentivizing subnational entities by compensating them for maintaining land under forests is a much weaker approach that may not lead to the desired outcomes. Our findings are relevant since the next phase of allocation through fiscal transfers is under active consideration. Ensuring design compatibility in financial transfers complements and links up well with international goals to achieve climate mitigation through REDD+, as well as domestic priorities for achieving the SDGs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.",,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7211882472038269,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
4911909,Forest Resource Management and Its Climate-Change Mitigation Policies in Taiwan,"Based on high carbon emissions in recent years (i.e., about 11 metric tons in 2018) per capita in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents, Taiwan has actively development greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction action plans. One of the action plans has been to promote afforestation and reforestation in non-forested lands for carbon sequestration. Thus, this paper aims to address the forest resources in Taiwan by using the latest national survey, reporting on an interactive analysis of forest carbon sequestration, GHG emissions, and climate-change mitigation policies. In this regard, the methodology is based on the official websites of forest resources, GHG emissions, and carbon sequestration from the yearbooks, national statistics, and regulations relevant to the mitigation policies in the forestry sector. It is found that Taiwan's forest area is estimated to be 2.197 million hectares, which corresponds to a total forest stock volume of about 502.0 million cubic meters. During the period of 1990-2018, the change in total carbon sequestration did not vary much (with the exception of 2009), decreasing from 23.4 million metric tons in 1990 to 21.4 million metric tons in 2018. Compared to the total carbon dioxide emissions (i.e., 102.4 million metric tons in 1990 and 282.8 million metric tons in 2018), the contribution to GHG mitigation in the forestry sector shows a declining trend. However, biomass (i.e., wood) carbon sequestration indicates a slight increase from 20.4 million metric tons in 2010 to 20.7 million metric tons in 2018 due to the afforestation policy. Obviously, regulatory policies, based on the Forestry Act and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction & Management Act in 2015, play a vital role in mitigating GHG emissions in Taiwan.

The typical ethical framing of climate change has not yet accommodated this complexity. In addition, geoengineering has often been presented as a Plan B that would simply counter unintentional (and positive) anthropogenic forcing with intentional (and negative) anthropogenic forcing. This paper attempts to better address the complexity by outlining an ethical framework for reducing all anthropogenic forcing, a position it labels the 'climate imperative.' The paper considers geoengineering alongside various other anthropogenic forcing activities and discusses what the climate imperative would say about each of them.

Two of them, the Natural Forest Conservation Program (NFCP) and the Grain to Green Program (GTGP), are among the biggest programs in the world because of their ambitious goals, massive scales, huge payments, and potentially enormous impacts. The NFCP conserves natural forests through logging bans and afforestation with incentives to forest enterprises, whereas the GTGP converts cropland on steep slopes to forest and grassland by providing farmers with grain and cash subsidies. Overall ecological effects are beneficial, and socioeconomic effects are mostly positive. Whereas there are time lags in ecological effects, socioeconomic effects are more immediate. Both the NFCP and the GTGP also have global implications because they increase vegetative cover, enhance carbon sequestration, and reduce dust to other countries by controlling soil erosion. The future impacts of these programs may be even bigger. Extended payments for the GTGP have recently been approved by the central government for up to 8 years. The NFCP is likely to follow suit and receive renewed payments. To make these programs more effective, we recommend systematic planning, diversified funding, effective compensation, integrated research, and comprehensive monitoring.

An emergency DAC program, with investment of 1.2-1.9% of global GDP annually, removes 2.2-2.3 GtCO(2) yr(-1) in 2050, 13-20 GtCO(2) yr(-1) in 2075, and 570-840 GtCO(2) cumulatively over 2025-2100. Compared to a future in which policy efforts to control emissions follow current trends (SSP2-4.5), DAC substantially hastens the onset of net-zero CO2 emissions (to 2085-2095) and peak warming (to 2090-2095); yet warming still reaches 2.4-2.5 degrees C in 2100. Such massive CO2 removals hinge on near-term investment to boost the future capacity for upscaling. DAC is most cost-effective when using electricity sources already available today: hydropower and natural gas with renewables; fully renewable systems are more expensive because their low load factors do not allow efficient amortization of capital-intensive DAC plants. Governments may struggle to impose costly polices on vital industries, resulting in a greater need for negative emissions. Here, the authors model a direct air capture crash deployment program, finding it can remove 2.3 GtCO(2) yr(-1) in 2050, 13-20 GtCO(2) yr(-1) in 2075, and 570-840 GtCO(2) cumulative over 2025-2100.",,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7172082662582397,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
3875061,Potential for large-scale CO2 removal via enhanced rock weathering with croplands,"Enhanced silicate rock weathering (ERW), deployable with croplands, has potential use for atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (CDR), which is now necessary to mitigate anthropogenic climate change(1). ERW also has possible co-benefits for improved food and soil security, and reduced ocean acidification(2-4). Here we use an integrated performance modelling approach to make an initial techno-economic assessment for 2050, quantifying how CDR potential and costs vary among nations in relation to business-as-usual energy policies and policies consistent with limiting future warming to 2 degrees Celsius(5). China, India, the USA and Brazil have great potential to help achieve average global CDR goals of 0.5 to 2gigatonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year with extraction costs of approximately US$80-180 per tonne of CO2. These goals and costs are robust, regardless of future energy policies. Deployment within existing croplands offers opportunities to align agriculture and climate policy. However, success will depend upon overcoming political and social inertia to develop regulatory and incentive frameworks. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of ERW deployment, including the potential for excess industrial silicate materials (basalt mine overburden, concrete, and iron and steel slag) to obviate the need for new mining, as well as uncertainties in soil weathering rates and land-ocean transfer of weathered products.",,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7168867588043213,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
897859,"Mitigation gambles: uncertainty, urgency and the last gamble possible","A rejection by current generations of more ambitious mitigation of carbon emissions inflicts on future generations inherently objectionable risks about which they have no choice. Any gains through savings from less ambitious mitigation, which are relatively minor, would accrue to current generations, and all losses, which are relatively major, would fall on future generations. This mitigation gamble is especially unjustifiable because it imposes a risk of unlimited losses until carbon emissions cease. Ultimate physical collapses remain possible. Much more ominous is prior social collapse from political struggles over conflicting responses to threatened physical collapse. The two most plausible objections to the thesis that less ambitious mitigation is unjustifiable rely, respectively, on the claim that negative emissions will allow a later recovery from a temporary overshoot in emissions and on the claim that ambitious mitigation is incompatible with poverty alleviation that depends on inexpensive fossil fuels. Neither objection stands up. Reliance on negative emissions later instead of ambitious mitigation now permits the passing of tipping points for irreversible change meanwhile, and non-carbon energy is rapidly becoming price competitive in developing countries like India that are committed to poverty alleviation.

3196305,China's pathway to a low carbon economy,"Climate change has emerged as one of the most important environmental issues worldwide. As the world's biggest developing country, China is participating in combating climate change by promoting a low carbon economy within the context of global warming. This paper summarizes the pathways of China's low carbon economy including the aspects of energy, industry, low carbon cities, circular economy and low carbon technology, afforestation and carbon sink, the carbon emission trading market and carbon emission reduction targets. There are many achievements in the implementation of low carbon policies. For example, carbon emission intensity has been reduced drastically along with the optimizing of energy and industry structure and a nationwide carbon trading market for electricity industry has been established. However, some problems remain, such as the weakness of public participation, the ineffectiveness of unified policies for certain regions and the absence of long-term planning for low carbon cities development. Therefore, we propose some policy recommendations for the future low carbon economy development in China. Firstly, comprehensive and long-term planning should be involved in all the low carbon economy pathways. Secondly, to coordinate the relationship between central and local governments and narrow the gap between poor and rich regions, different strategies of carbon emission performance assessment should be applied for different regions. Thirdly, enterprises should cooperate with scientific research institutions to explored low carbon technologies. Finally, relevant institutions should be regulated to realize comprehensive low carbon transition through reasonable and feasible low carbon pathways in China. These policy recommendations will provide new perspectives for China's future low carbon economy development and guide practices for combating climate change.",China; Pathway; Low carbon; Economy,Review,2019.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.716575026512146,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

In particular, terrestrial atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR) can reduce climate change impacts while increasing resilience to extreme weather. Currently, many CDR technologies and strategies are still under research and development (R&D), and lack sufficient federal support to reach widespread deployment. Here, we provide an assessment of the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) existing programs and organizational structure, its capacity to support research and demonstration of CDR, and recommendations for expansion of these capabilities. We summarize USDA's previous and current efforts to incorporate CDR R&D within their research, education, and economics mission, as well as opportunities to refocus and expand existing programs. Potential future actions to expand CDR R&D capabilities include: (1) the establishment of a new extramural research agency and an intramural technology commercialization program within USDA, (2) improved coordination between the Foundation for Food and Agriculture (FFAR) and USDA, (3) improved intra-agency and inter-agency coordination, and (4) congressional action to establish and fund new CDR programs within USDA. USDA can pursue multiple strategies to enhance CDR, driving development, demonstration, and deployment across the United States.

660998,Between Tun Mustapha and the deep blue sea: the political ecology of blue carbon in Sabah,"Coastal 'blue carbon' ecosystem resources are rich carbon stores, offer extensive benefits beyond carbon sequestration, and are marginalized in global markets and policy mechanisms. The participation of blue carbon project activities in international market frameworks is limited by a dearth of appropriate research across disciplinary boundaries, particularly in terms of the cultural and political dynamics that affect project implementation. The socially and politically charged contexts of many developing countries constrain project opportunities, and understanding specific local governance dynamics is therefore of critical importance to policy makers, development practitioners, and the private sector. This paper applies a systems-based political ecology research and analytical approach to explore the social and political dynamics affecting the potential development of blue carbon projects in a proposed marine reserve in Sabah, Malaysia. The investigative focus is situated in its historical context, described and mapped as an influence system in collaboration with local experts, with the elements of that system then explored in detail, through a workshop, survey, and interviews with a diverse range of local stakeholders. Key findings include that historical realities play a vital role in present relationships; effective governance is likely to require international collaboration to minimize inequity and corruption; race and religion continue to be used as tools of political imperialism; and dominant actors in Sabah would be well advised to recognize the growing, informed cohesion of Sabahan society, and its drive for equitable, ecologically sustainable development. The paper contributes a novel methodological approach to sustainability science research, provides unique data on a case study area relevant to climate change policy, and identifies important leverage points for the development of blue carbon finance and policy instruments in South-East Asia and beyond.

571456,Protecting climate with forests,"Policies for climate mitigation on land rarely acknowledge biophysical factors, such as reflectivity, evaporation, and surface roughness. Yet such factors can alter temperatures much more than carbon sequestration does, and often in a conflicting way. We outline a framework for examining biophysical factors in mitigation policies and provide some best-practice recommendations based on that framework. Tropical projects-avoided deforestation, forest restoration, and afforestation-provide the greatest climate value, because carbon storage and biophysics align to cool the Earth. In contrast, the climate benefits of carbon storage are often counteracted in boreal and other snow-covered regions, where darker trees trap more heat than snow does. Managers can increase the climate benefit of some forest projects by using more reflective and deciduous species and through urban forestry projects that reduce energy use. Ignoring biophysical interactions could result in millions of dollars being invested in some mitigation projects that provide little climate benefit or, worse, are counter-productive.",afforestation; albedo; avoided deforestation; biophysics; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate policy; forest restoration; global warming; tropical; temperate and boreal forests,Article,2008.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7154348492622375,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Because of such reasons as rapid increase of population, unplanned logging to obtain building materials and firewood, and besides forest fires, the forest in Madagascar disappears by about 120,000 ha that corresponds to about 1% of the total forest area per year in average and the forest is changing to grassland rapidly. The Madagascar Government declares ""the conservation of forests and reforestation"" as one of the national policies because it is urgent and most important problem. However, the forest area does not increase up to now owing to such reasons as shortage of funds and technology, ill-preparation of both the related legislation and measures of preferential treatment, and so on. If the plan is put into force, we plant eucalyptuses etc. in about 15,000 ha grassland defined as ""afforestation"" in Kyoto Mechanism and repeat logging and reforestation there, we secure the stable raw materials for pulping and in addition to it we expect the acquisition of about one million tons CO 2 credit. On the other hand, Madagascar is able to expect many kinds of the following advantages for environment and economical or social fields including the promotion of national policy, the preparation of infrastructures such as load and harbor etc. and additionally, the creation of employment of local people through the new industry, the rise in living standard through stable income and the improvement of environmental protection consciousness for existing forest and so on.

It first reviews the recent policy action and then assesses the challenges ahead. It shows that emissions in 2012 will be below the Kyoto target only if the carbon intensity of the economies continues to decline at the pre-crisis rate. Even in this favorable case, the use of Kyoto mechanisms will likely be necessary to compensate for the high emissions of 2008. This article then examines the implications of reducing emissions in 2050 by 80% with respect to the present level, as proposed by Major Economies Leaders during the 2009 G8 meeting. In particular, the article focuses on the transformations needed in the power sector. Scenarios developed using the integrated assessment model World Induced Hybrid Technical Change (WITCH) and an analysis of historical data show that (1) electricity in 2050 must come with zero (or possibly negative) emissions, and therefore, absent nuclear power and (2) carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) must play a major role in future power supply, even with a massive development of wind and photovoltaic. The article then proposes five pillars on which a sensible, long-term, ambitious Italian climate mitigation policy should rest.

To do so, the chapter analyses the characteristics of New Zealand economy, the institutional and regulatory context for domestic abatement, and considers the barriers to the further uptake of these technologies in a range of sectors. The New Zealand Emission Trading Scheme (NZ ETS), as well as institutional responses to transport, distributed energy, and geothermal technologies, is all considered.

The role prioritization of various hydrogen production technologies is of vital importance for the stakeholders/decision-makers to plan the development of hydrogen. economy in China and to allocate the finite R&D budget reasonably. In this study, DPSIR framework was firstly used to identify the key factors concerning the priorities of various hydrogen production technologies; then, a fuzzy group decision-making method by incorporating fuzzy AHP and fuzzy TOPSIS was proposed to prioritize the roles of different technologies. The proposed method is capable of allowing multiple groups of stakeholders/decision-makers to participate in the decision-making and addressing problems with uncertainty and imprecise information. The prioritization results by using the proposed method demonstrated that the technologies of coal gasification with CO2 capture and storage and hydropower-based water electrolysis were regarded as the two most important hydrogen production pathways for promoting the development of hydrogen economy in China among the five assessed technologies.

90242,"Public perceptions and governance of controversial technologies to tackle climate change: nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, wind, and geoengineering","The role carbon emissions play in contributing to climate change makes clear the necessity for a global reconsideration of current modes of energy production. In recent years, as concerns over the threats of climate change (CC) have become more acute, four technologies have notably risen to the forefront of academic and public discourse: nuclear power, carbon capture and storage (CCS), wind power, and geoengineering. The particular interest of these four approaches lies in the fact that they reflect both energy production and climate control technologies, are often socially controversial, and present complex challenges of governance. Nuclear and wind power both deserve an important place among the variety of low-carbon energy options. In countries where public acceptance is evaluated, although, support for nuclear energy appears to be conditional upon simultaneous development of other renewable energies alongside a feasible plan to address the disposal of nuclear waste. The Fukushima accident sharply increased public concern about the safety and vulnerability of nuclear reactors. While wind power receives general public support, issues of accommodation can arise when it comes to siting wind farms. Persistent dependency upon carbon-producing energy has made favorable the option of CCS. However, in addition to technical and geological factors, social resistance to the placement of carbon storage units remains a key obstacle. Geoengineering offers the technological capacity to directly act on the climate should levels of atmospheric CO2 become dangerously high. Public perception regarding the risk of climate change can be labile, and the alternatives reviewed here share the characteristic that their technical and political dimensions are intertwined. The variety of options for combining and implementing these technologies, coupled with the inherently time-sensitive nature of CC, underscore the complexity of the endeavor. In order to bridge these various levels of analysis and decision making, and to better understand and integrate people's involvement, exercises in risk governance could be developed at both the national and international levels.

4755023,Barriers and opportunities facing the UK Peatland Code: A case-study of blended green finance,"Blended finance offers a way of increasing total expenditure on tackling the twin climate and biodiversity global emergencies. However, this requires effective methods for combining private and public funding. As an example of the barriers and opportunities facing practical implementation of a blended finance approach, this Viewpoint paper presents a case-study of the UK Peatland Code which will have relevance to other instances of blended finance initiatives elsewhere. Restoration of degraded peatlands reduces their carbon emissions and can provide emission reductions and other environmental gains in a socially cost-effective manner. However, many benefits are public goods arising as externalities which are difficult to convert into financial returns to private investors. To address this problem, the Peatland Code has been developed as a voluntary certification standard for UK peatland projects wishing to seek additional private funding via the voluntary carbon market. However, uptake of the Peatland Code has been slow. Despite growing demand in the voluntary carbon market, we observe six main barriers to supply-side uptake: lack of awareness amongst land managers; resistance to land use change, particularly when measures are seen to potentially compromise agricultural production; high upfront capital costs; limited equipment and skills; uncertainty over ongoing costs and support; and, administrative bureaucracy/inflexibility. We offer recommendations for how such barriers could be reduced to increase supply-side uptake, including: increased effort to promote sustainable land management and blended financing of it, and restoration activities and the Peatland Code in particular; continued public funding of upfront capital investments, with private funding directed more at ongoing payments; and, simplified and more flexible administrative arrangements, with public and private schemes designed in tandem to improve their practical complementarity.",Agri-environment schemes; Carbon credits; Ecosystem markets; Land use policy; Payments for Ecosystem Services,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.7115705013275146,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
637096,EU strategies and policies on soil and waste management to offset greenhouse gas emissions,"Climate change has become an important political priority in the environmental field, and beyond. To revert the increase in the Earth's temperature, developed country parties to the Kyoto Protocol committed to limit their greenhouse gas emissions. The 15 Member States that made up the European Community in 1997 have a combined reduction target of 8%, in CO2-equivalent emissions in the period 2008-2012 compared to 1990. The role of soil, both as a source and a sink for carbon, is particularly important. How can soil organic matter be maintained or increased? There is no single answer, and a broad range of options need to be explored. Among the different measures proposed, the promotion of organic input on arable land (crop residues, cover crops, farm yard manure, compost, sewage Sludge) has been mentioned. The challenge is to ensure that organic wastes of good quality are used to increase soil organic matter in carbon depleted soils and that appropriate monitoring is established. On the waste management front, the European Commission intends to produce guidance for Member States on the management of biowaste that will take into account all related environmental issues, including soil aspects. As for monitoring, the European Commission has put forward legislation according to which Member States would have to identify the areas at risk of soil organic matter decline in their national territory. Such legislation should be regarded as a major step forward for Europe, as it would ensure a high level of soil protection across the Community. This development will have the potential to enable the kind of estimation, measurement or modelling of crop or grazing land management needed for accounting under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol.

In March 2012, the EPA announced a proposed carbon pollution standard for new power plants. Then in September 2013, the EPA withdrew the proposal upon issuing a revision as part of President Obama's Climate Action Plan. This article analyzes the stringency of the proposed emission standards for new electricity generating units relative to the emission rates of existing, recently constructed, and proposed units in the United States. No coal-fired units would come close to the emission targets unless there are future innovations in carbon capture and storage. While natural gas units designed to meet peak demand are effectively exempt, very few of them would comply on an annual basis. For the baseload natural gas units-that is, combined-cycle gas turbine units-we find that between 90 and 95 percent of the units that began operating in 2006 or later would already meet the proposed targets.

564937,Reconciling emissions trading with a technology-based response to potential abrupt climate change,"It has been shown that preparedness to respond effectively to imminent abrupt climate change, getting CO2 levels down towards pre-industrial in a few decades, involves the promotion of specific technology types that can be the basis for a negative emissions energy system (Read and Lermit 2003/5). In particular, Bio-Energy technologies linked to technologies for CO2 Capture and Storage (BECS) or to other carbon disposal technologies, if done on a sufficiently large scale, can achieve this result given a context of policy urgency that also yields advances in energy efficiency and the take up of ambient energy technologies (wind, solar, etc.) in line with low emissions energy scenarios (e.g. the fossil free energy scenario developed by the Tellus Institute for Greenpeace International (Lazarus et al. 1993). It has also been shown (Read 1999, 2000, 2000a) that, if account is taken of inter-temporal beneficial learning externalities, it is efficient to reward innovation in policy-desirable technology types (e.g. through project-based schemes that embody such technology types) by a greater amount than the penalty on emissions. Such dynamic efficiency can be achieved through establishing a secondary market for project based credits exchanged for a number of emissions permits M(t) (M &gt; 1 for t &lt; H, the time horizon for policy) and with the variation of M(t) over time corresponding to the dynamically efficient path. This results in the incentive for project based emissions reductions being M(t) times greater than the penalty on emissions. By making use of the initial allocation of permits in each time period, an aspect of emissions permit trading that has no efficiency function under either auctioning or 'grand-fathering', this arrangement enables project based credits to be administered flexibly whilst ensuring the integrity of the emissions cap. The purpose of this article is to link these two bodies of work to show how a dynamically efficient response to the threat of abrupt climate change can be implemented in a way that is compatible with the response to gradual climate change that has been negotiated in the Kyoto Protocol. The design of such a dynamically efficient mechanism is considered, having as its objective the promotion of the two technology types mentioned above. A particular institutional model for implementing such a mechanism is described that mimics managerial behaviour in the adoption of new technology, avoids the additionality requirement that burdens the operation of the CDM in its current form, and aims to achieve 'industry friendliness' as a necessary condition of effective implementation. © Springer 2006.",climate change; emission control; emissions trading; energy efficiency; energy policy; Kyoto Protocol; technological development,Conference Paper,2006.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.709400475025177,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Scientists have highlighted the additional research that must be completed to understand the efficacy and impact of OIF at either scale.

820750,The IEA CCS Technology Roadmap: One Year On,"In October 2009, the International Energy Agency's CCS Technology Roadmap was launched at the Carbon Sequestration Leadership forum (CSLF) Ministerial Meeting in London. The Roadmap builds on the IEA BLUE Map scenario that leads to the stabilisation of CO2 emissions at 450ppm by 2050. Achieving this scenario will require an energy technology revolution involving a portfolio of solutions: greater energy efficiency, increased renewable energy technologies and nuclear power, and the near decarbonisation of fossil fuel-based power generation via carbon capture and storage (CCS). In this scenario CCS contributes almost 20% to the total emissions reductions required in 2050. Recommendations are made in the IEA CCS Roadmap on what is required to achieve this level of deployment not only technically, but also from a financial and regulatory point of view as well as in terms of public engagement and international collaboration, including the sharing of knowledge. This paper looks at progress made against these recommendations in the 12 months since the release of the roadmap. Analysis undertaken by the IEA consistently identifies a significant role for CCS in mitigating global CO2 emissions. IEA analysis suggests that there will be a need to capture and store 10 Gt CO2 per year in 2050, from 3400 projects globally to achieve the BLUE Map emissions reduction targets. Significant progress is being made to launch large-scale demonstration facilities across the globe, with some 80 large-scale integrated demonstration projects identified. As of April 2010, public funding commitments were in the range of USD 26.6 billion to USD 36.1 billion. While 5500km of CO2 pipelines already exist and further infrastructure development is planned, it is however clear that to enable large-scale deployment of CCS, more joint planning of CO2 transportation infrastructure is required globally. The status and availability of data on CO2 storage varies significantly around the world and is potentially a major constraint to rapid, widespread CCS deployment. In regions with the potential to store large volumes of CO2, a concerted effort will be required to characterise the basins in sufficient detail. Much progress has been achieved in the legal and regulatory area. The first movers in establishing legal frameworks have generally been OECD countries. It is now important that the large emerging economies start developing their legal and regulatory frameworks. Public awareness and acceptance is a key element in making CCS possible. Public concerns are legitimate and require a close dialogue and sharing of information with the local population. While companies developing transport and storage will need to lead on the engagement processes, governments and politicians have a vital role to play. Several initiatives are in place for international dialogue and collaboration on the development and deployment of CCS. While much progress has been made, many challenges still remain if CCS is to deliver at the scale required. The challenges are well-known and require concerted action by industry, governments, international organisations and civil society. Continued political leadership remains absolutely essential.

2278062,Co-producing climate policy and negative emissions: Trade-offs for sustainable land-use,"Non-Technical summary Under the Paris Agreement, nations have committed to preventing dangerous global warming. Scenarios for achieving net-zero emissions in the second half of this century depend on land (forests and bioenergy) to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Modelled levels of land-based mitigation could reduce the availability of productive agricultural land, and encroach on natural land, with potentially significant social and environmental consequences. However, these issues are poorly recognized in the policy-uptake of modelled outputs. Understanding how science and policy interact to produce expectations about mitigation pathways allows us to consider the trade-offs inherent in relying on land for mitigation. Technical summary Science enables better understanding of climate change causes and impacts but may also define the 'climate problem' in technical terms, with technical solutions, as seen in the recent inclusion of negative emissions technologies (NETs) in Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) to meet the Paris Agreement's temperature goals. This paper examines the sustainability of land-based carbon removal, using a co-production lens to explain the legitimization of NETs as key mitigation options. We evaluate the scale of NETs in the most recent generation of <2 °C scenarios, finding that projected levels of land-based mitigation imply strong trade-offs with other societal goals. Future demand for bioenergy from dedicated cropland drives large-scale land-use change across all models. Upper ranges of modelled outputs would require up to a doubling of global cropland, with potential losses of up to a quarter of both current pasture and natural lands by 2100. We find that the perception of model-based knowledge as 'objective science' lends authority to outcomes that might otherwise be more critically debated and contested. Closer engagement between modellers and policy experts for mitigation scenario development would allow for more negotiated forms of knowledge production that might better clarify and represent the multiple objectives and interests at stake in the utilization of limited land resources. © The Author(s) 2018.",,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7085631489753723,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Contrary to the common view that successful remediation technologies will permit the wheels of industry to turn without interruption, we argue that such technologies do not exculpate polluters of responsibility. To make this case, we examine several environmental and non-environmental cases.

311217,An optimized policy for the reduction of CO2 emission in the Brazilian Legal Amazon,"The Brazilian government has already acknowledged the importance of investing in the development and application of technologies to reduce or prevent CO2 emissions resulting from human activities in the Legal Brazilian Amazon (BA). The BA corresponds to a total area of 5 x 10(6) km(2) from which 4 x 10(6) km(2) was originally covered by the rain forest. One way to interfere with the net balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions is to increase the forest area to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. The single most important cause of depletion of the rain forest is cattle ranching. In this work, we present an effective policy to reduce the net balance of CO2 emissions using optimal control theory to obtain a compromising partition of investments in reforestation and promotion of clear technology to achieve a CO2 emission target for 2020. The simulation indicates that a CO2 emission target for 2020 of 376 million tonnes requires an estimated forest area by 2020 of 3,708,000 km(2), demanding a reforestation of 454,037 km(2). Even though the regional economic growth can foster the necessary political environment for the commitment with optimal emission targets, the reduction of 38.9% of carbon emissions until 2020 proposed by Brazilian government seems too ambitious.

Both efforts have failed to achieve the scale of action needed to halt biodiversity loss or mitigate climate change. We argue that success can be achieved by aligning targets for biodiversity protection with the habitat protection and restoration necessary to bring down greenhouse gas concentrations and promote natural and societal adaptation to climate change. Success, however, will need much higher targets for environmental protection than the present 10% of sea and 17% of land. A new target of 30% of the sea given high levels of protection from exploitation and harm by 2030 is under consideration and similar targets are being discussed for terrestrial habitats.

Using the insights from a long-term bottom-up energy systems model, and undertaking a sectoral assessment, we investigated the importance of CCS in the industrial sector. Under climate policy aimed at limiting atmospheric concentration of GHGs to 650 ppm CO(2)e, costs could increase fivefold when CCS is excluded from the portfolio of mitigation option measures in the industry sector as compared to when CCS is excluded in the power sector. This effect is driven largely by the lack of alternatives for deep emission reductions in industry. Our main policy conclusion is that a broader recognition of CCS in industrial applications in both current policy discussions and research, development, and demonstration funding programmes is justified. In recognition of the heterogeneity of the many types of industrial production processes, the size and location of industrial CO2 sources, the specific need for CCS-retrofitting, and the exposure of most industrial sectors to international trade, policies aimed at supporting CCS must distinguish between the different challenges faced by the power and industrial sectors.",CO2 capture and storage (CCS); industrial sector; energy technology; climate change mitigation,Article,2014.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.7039414644241333,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

After outlining this moral position, this article examines the consequences of these limitations on the viability of community forest participation in the CDM through a case study of three community forests in West Africa. Results suggest that there is significant carbon mitigation potential from forest conservation, reforestation as well as from improved fuelwood cookstoves at the community level.

This paper tries to put into perspective the need for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in India’s energy sector, specific to coal. It tries to make the argument that the policymakers must not solely depend on fairly new technologies like power generation via solar, without taking care of the existing coalfired power plants. Thus, putting forward the opportunities for CCS supported by necessary literature is undertaken as the principal task for this paper. The potential for CCS is discussed in terms of relevant capture and storage techniques in a technological and cost-based standpoint. Some of the considerations that can facilitate the deployment of CCS in various sectors pertaining to the industry are discussed. The paper also presents the need for discussing technologies such as direct air capture (DAC) in the Indian context. The review also presents a substantive view for CCS prospects in India, by reviewing its environmental and operational issues.

27939,An introduction to the carbon farming initiative: Key principles and concepts,"In December 2011, the Australian Government introduced a project-based, baseline-and-credit carbon offset certification scheme called the Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI). The scheme is one of the broadest and most comprehensive domestic offset schemes of its type in the world. Its formal objectives are to assist in the achievement of Australia’s greenhouse gas mitigation obligations and promote abatement in a manner that will protect the environment and improve resilience to the effects of climate change. Most significantly, the CFI will provide the basis for the generation of certified offsets for use in the Australian carbon pricing scheme under the Clean Energy Act 2011 (Cth) (CE Act) and for sale to overseas buyers. It will also certify domestic offsets for use in voluntary markets. This article describes and analyses key aspects of the CFI and sheds light on its relationship with the international greenhouse accounting rules and the CE Act’s carbon pricing scheme. It also evaluates the effectiveness of the mechanisms that have been put in place to deal with integrity risks and secondary impacts associated with the scheme. It is concluded that the CFI has the capacity to significantly reduce the cost of meeting Australia’s mitigation targets and promote more sustainable land-management practices.

160124,Developing a test-bed for robust research governance of geoengineering: the contribution of ocean iron biogeochemistry,"Geoengineering to mitigate climate change has long been proposed, but remains nebulous. Exploration of the feasibility of geoengineering first requires the development of research governance to move beyond the conceptual towards scientifically designed pilot studies. Fortuitously, 12 mesoscale (approx. 1000km2) iron enrichments, funded to investigate how ocean iron biogeochemistry altered Earth's carbon cycle in the geological past, provide proxies to better understand the benefits and drawbacks of geoengineering. The utility of these iron enrichments in the geoengineering debate is enhanced by the GEOTRACES global survey. Here, we outline how GEOTRACES surveys and process studies can provide invaluable insights into geoengineering. Surveys inform key unknowns including the regional influence and magnitude of modes of iron supply, and stimulate iron biogeochemical modelling. These advances will enable quantification of interannual variability of iron supply to assess whether any future purposeful multi-year iron-fertilization meets the principle of 'additionality' (sensu Kyoto protocol). Process studies address issues including upscaling of geoengineering, and how differing iron-enrichment strategies could stimulate wide-ranging biogeochemical outcomes. In summary, the availability of databases on both mesoscale iron-enrichment studies and the GEOTRACES survey, along with modelling, policy initiatives and legislation have positioned the iron-enrichment approach as a robust multifaceted test-bed to assess proposed research into climate intervention.

333723,Investing in nature: Developing ecosystem service markets for peatland restoration,"To meet the challenge of proactive ecosystem-based climate mitigation and adaptation, new sources of funding are needed. Peatlands provide the most efficient global store of terrestrial carbon. Degraded peatlands, however, contribute disproportionally to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with approximately 25% of all CO2 emissions from the land use sector, while restoration can be cost-effective. Peatland restoration therefore provides a newopportunity for investing in ecosystem-based mitigation through the development of carbon markets. Set in the international policy and carbon market context, this paper demonstrates the necessary scientific evidence and policy frameworks needed to develop ecosystem service markets for peatland restoration. Using the UK and NE Germany as case studies, we outline the climate change mitigation potential of peatlands and how changes in GHG emissions after restoration may be measured. We report on market demand research in carbon market investments that provide sponsors with quantification and officially certified recognition of the climate and other co-benefits. Building on this, we develop the necessary requirements for developing regional carbon markets to fund peatland restoration. While this paper focuses on the UK and German context, it draws on international experience, and is likely to be directly applicable across peatlands in Europe and North America.

Denmark is renowned for its pioneering use of wind energy, Finland and Sweden bioenergy, Norway hydroelectricity and Iceland geothermal energy. All countries aim to be virtually ""fossil free"" by 2050. This study explores the Nordic energy transition through the lens of three interconnected research questions: How are they doing it? What challenges exist? And what broader lessons result for energy policy? The study firstly investigates the pathways necessary for these five countries to achieve their low-carbon goals. It argues that a concerted effort must be made to (1) promote decentralized and renewable forms of electricity supply; (2) shift to more sustainable forms of transport; (3) further improve the energy efficiency of residential and commercial buildings; and (4) adopt carbon capture and storage technologies for industry. However, the section that follows emphasizes some of the empirical barriers the Nordic transition must confront, namely political contestation, technological contingency, and social justice and recognition concerns.

49193,Hype among low-carbon technologies: Carbon capture and storage in comparison,"Carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology has become a crucial part of climate change mitigation strategies around the world; yet its progress has been slow. Some have criticised CCS as a distracting hype, even as mainstream support continues. This article adapts the literature on technological hypes to develop a framework suitable for technologies with limited media/public exposure, such as CCS. It provides a qualitative context and analyses seven quantitative indicators of hype that are largely internal to the CCS technology regime. Throughout, the article contrasts results for CCS with those of comparable technologies. The main findings, which support the view that CCS has been hyped, are as follows. ""Expectations"" mounted rapidly in the form of project announcements for electricity applications of CCS and deployment forecasts in influential reports. However, announcements soon plummeted. ""Commitments"" remained high, nonetheless, judging by allocations in public budgets and number of peer-reviewed publications. Meanwhile, ""outcomes"" in terms of patents, prototypes and estimated costs reveal few if any improvements for CCS. Considering these findings and the characteristics of CCS, its development is likely to be more difficult than initially expected. Accordingly, this article calls for decisively prioritising CCS for industrial and, potentially, bioenergy uses. Coal- and gas-fired power plants may be replaced by non-CCS technologies, so power CCS development is far less pressing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

1299835,Pricing forest carbon: Implications of asymmetry in climate policy,"Using an integrated assessment model, we examine the implications of climate policies that do not fully recognize forest carbon. Specifically, we first investigate the impact of an asymmetric policy that recognizes carbon emissions from fossil fuels while fully ignoring forest carbon. Next, we investigate the relative importance of not recognizing emissions from a reduction in the stock of forest biomass compared to not recognizing sequestration from the growth of forest biomass. We show that asymmetric carbon policies lead to lower levels of welfare, as well as higher emissions and carbon prices. This occurs because the forest resource will be allocated inefficiently under these carbon policies. Broadly, we find that when the social planner does not account for emissions or sequestration from the forest, the planner will set bioenergy levels that are too high and afforestation and avoided deforestation levels that are too low. Our results further reveal that not recognizing forest emissions leads to larger welfare losses than not recognizing sequestration.",Climate policy; Forest carbon; Carbon neutrality; Integrated assessment model,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6980549693107605,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Conventional power plants are needed to guarantee continuity of supply at tolerable prices. 3. Clean coal.

These include carbon dioxide removal approaches that are becoming a key pillar of post-Paris assessment and governance, as well as the more controversial suite of solar geoengineering methods. In this paper, we ask: Who defends and opposes these experiments, and why? After screening 44 early-stage experiments, we conduct a qualitative comparative analysis of 21 of them in five areas: ocean fertilization, marine cloud brightening, stratospheric aerosol injection, ice protection, and enhanced weathering. We develop a common framework of analysis, treating experiments as sites in which the risks and appropriate governance of early-stage science and technology are envisioned and disputed among scientists and other social groups. Our contribution is to map and explain the key issues of contention (why), actors (who), and tactics (how) that have shaped opposition across these linked fields of experimentation and technological development, from the 1990s till today. In doing so, we build upon and connect past studies on particular climate experiments and develop insights relevant to governance outlooks perceptions, discourses, and intents surrounding immature but potentially crucial climate technologies. © 2022",,Article,2022.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.6972033381462097,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
688625,Carbon and greenhouse gas mitigation through soil carbon sequestration potential of adaptive agriculture and agroforestry systems,"Agriculture together with agro-forestry systems are perceived as a source of significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, With concomitant potentials for mitigation. It is among the economic sectors having the largest GHG mitigation potential. Conversion to invigorating land uses and implementation of recommended management practices (RMP) can enhance soil organic carbon (SOC). The adoption of these alternatives is likely to have considerable benefits for some cropping systems under moderate climate change. The C sequestration potential in soils of terrestrial ecosystems is 3x10(9) tonnes C/year or 0.05% reduction of atmospheric CO2 at the rate of 1 Mg/ha/year by improving C pool by the end of the year 2099. The role of forest and grasslands as a sink for atmospheric CO2 is the subject of active debate. The carbon stock for the period 2006-2030 is projected to increase from 8.79x10(9) tonnes C to 9.75x10(9) tonnes C with forest cover becoming more or less stable, and new forest carbon accretions coming from the current initiatives of afforestation and reforestation programme. With the knowledge and information that is now emerging, the role of agro-forest and plantations in mitigation is becoming more and more important. Over the past decades, national policies of India aimed at conservation and sustainable management of forests have transformed India's forests into a net sink of CO2. Not all improved management practices are suitable to all soils and ecological conditions. Dealing with many barriers to effective adaptation will require a comprehensive and dynamic policy approach covering a range of scales and issues. A crucial component of this approach is the implementation of adaptation assessment frame works that are relevant, robust and easily operated by all stakeholders, practitioners, policymakers and scientists.",Carbon sequestration; Greenhouse gases; Soil management; Soil organic carbon,Article,2013.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6970838904380798,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
111417,"Pimping climate change: Richard Branson, global warming, and the performance of green capitalism","On 21 September 2006 UK uber-entrepreneur and Virgin Group Chairman Richard Branson pledged approximately 1.6 pound billion, the equivalent of all the profits from Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Trains for the next ten years, to fighting climate change. Since then, Branson has restated his commitment to action on global warming, including investment in technologies for sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this paper, I critically examine and engage with Branson's announcements as a specific entree into a dialog about so-called 'green capitalism'. I am particularly interested in the role of the entrepreneurial subject in environmental policy and environmental action. There are glaring problems associated with green capitalism as a mash-up of environmentalism with capitalism. One of these is the tethering of environmentalism to a political economy whose mantra is growth for growth's sake, or, in Marx's terms, accumulation for accumulation's sake. This has been discussed by some as the problem of capitalism's ecological metabolism or 'metabolic rift'. Yet, while accumulation for accumulation's sake may well be anathema to progressive environmentalism and sustainability, I argue that this is not only an objective, quantitative problem but also one of the qualitative dimensions of produced nature and the cultural politics of environmentalism. Appreciation of this can be gleaned by reexamining Marx's discussion of the role of the bourgeois subject in the relentless drive to reproduce and expand capital accumulation via anarchic, entrepreneurial investment. Green capitalist orthodoxy relies on this source of innovative dynamism, but in the process obscures or overlooks the fact that accumulation for accumulation's sake is by definition guided by the anarchic and amoral search for profitable realization of surplus value. Moreover, in order for green capitalism to succeed, its legitimacy must be secured. I argue that this legitimacy derives in part from specific performances of green capitalism by entrepreneurial elites, also made evident by Branson and his commitments to climate action. All of this raises questions about the political, cultural, and ecological character of green capitalism, issues brought to the fore by Branson's brand of climate activism.",,Review,2009.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6951942443847656,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

383848,"Peatlands, carbon storage, greenhouse gases, and the Kyoto Protocol: Prospects and significance for Canada","The Kyoto Protocol accepts terrestrial sinks for greenhouse gases (GHGs) as offsets for fossil fuel emissions. Only carbon sequestered in Living biomass from re- and afforestation is presently considered, but the Protocol contains a provision for the possible future inclusion of other land uses and soils. As a result, the possibility of sequestration of carbon in wetlands, and particularly peatlands, is being discussed. Natural peatlands are presently a relatively small sink for CO2 and a large source of CH4: globally, they store between 400 and 500 Gt C. There are large variations among peatlands, but when the ""global warming potential"" of CH4 is factored in, many peatlands are neither sinks nor sources of GHGs. Some land-use changes may result in peatlands acting as net sinks far GHGs by reducing CH4 emissions and/or increasing CO2 sequestration (e.g., forest drainage), while other land uses may result in large losses of CO2, CH4, and N2O (e.g., agriculture on organic soils, flooding for hydroelectric generation). Other land uses, such as peatland creation and restoration, produce no net change if they are replacing or restoring a previous level of GHG exchange. These are analogous to reforestation of deforested areas. On closer examination, the inclusion of peatlands in a national greenhouse gas strategy as sinks, despite their large role in the terrestrial carbon cycle, may not significantly reduce net greenhouse gas emissons. If the sinks are to be considered, it is reasonable that terrestrial sources associated with all land uses on peatlands also should be considered. If peatlands are not considered explicitly, but soils in forest and agriculture systems are included in the Kyoto Protocol in the future, then those peatlands impacted by these land uses will be incorporated implicitly.",peatlands; greenhouse gases; Kyoto Protocol; land-use change,Article,2000.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6948181390762329,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This represents a major expansion of earlier forest-oriented initiatives under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) that focused on afforestation and reforestation activities. While the scope of REDD projects is still being defined, potential categories include conservation, stock enhancement, and sustainable management, creating a range of new opportunities for forest-related climate projects. The core concept behind REDD is that deforestation trends can be slowed, halted, or even reversed conserving billions of tons of carbon that would otherwise be emitted. To succeed, REDD projects will need to control powerful drivers of deforestation and forest degradation operating at multiple levels and carried-out by a variety of actors, from rural people to political and economic elites. This case study of a REDD pilot project in northwest Cambodia explores how drivers might be contained under a project scenario and how the future international articulation of project design parameters could enable or constrain a global REDD strategy.

These transformations will have immediate impacts on various of the sustainable development goals. As goals such as affordable and clean energy and zero hunger are more immediate to great parts of global population, these impacts are central for societal acceptability of climate policies. Yet, little is known about how the achievement of other social and environmental sustainability objectives can be directly managed through emission reduction policies. In addition, the integrated assessment literature has so far emphasized a single, global (cost-minimizing) carbon price as the optimal mechanism to achieve emissions reductions. In this paper we introduce a broader suite of policies-including direct sector-level regulation, early mitigation action, and lifestyle changes-into the integrated energy-economy-land-use modeling system REMIND-MAgPIE. We examine their impact on non-climate sustainability issues when mean warming is to be kept well below 2 degrees C or 1.5 degrees C. We find that a combination of these policies can alleviate air pollution, water extraction, uranium extraction, food and energy price hikes, and dependence on negative emissions technologies, thus resulting in substantially reduced sustainability risks associated with mitigating climate change.

The first proposal integrates tCERs and ICERs (temporary credits) into the EU ETS by allowing for their direct use for compliance purposes. The second proposal builds on the idea of swapping temporary credits for EU allowances (EUAs) by Member States. The third proposal would not require a political decision at the EU level. Instead supportive Member States or private carbon fund operators would agree to swap temporary credits for the CERs or ERUs they hold in their accounts.

674287,Industrial ecology and carbon property rights,"This paper examines the potential for property rights in carbon to affect industrial ecology opportunities. Given that emissions trading schemes for greenhouse gases are becoming more widely implemented, the definition of the carbon property right can affect barriers and opportunities for industrial ecology, alongside other factors. The paper uses legislation for emissions trading in Australia and two possible scenarios for the future of energy generation in the Latrobe Valley, Australia in 2050 as an illustrative case study to identify issues for industrial ecology arising from ill-defined carbon property rights. Currently, electricity generation in the region is reliant on coal-based generators. Scenario one focuses on bio-industries and renewables with no coal usage; and scenario two focuses on electricity from coal with carbon capture and storage resulting in moderate to high coal use. If a carbon property right for soil carbon emerges before a property right for subterranean carbon, then bio-based industrial ecology opportunities could be enabled ahead of a regional symbiosis involving carbon capture and storage. A generalised framework for considering the intersection of industrial ecology and carbon property rights is presented with a focus on tensions in: contributing to sustainable development, system boundaries and finally exchange mechanisms.

386110,"Forests in climate policy: technical, institutional and economic issues in measurement and monitoring","Despite the economic and environmental significance of the world's forests, we have limited data about them. Estimates of deforestation in tropical countries and rates of reforestation or afforestation in boreal and temperate countries are inconsistent. Accordingly, estimates of emissions released in deforestation vary widely and range from 7% to 17% of all sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The lack of good data severely hampers efforts to shape climate policy because it is difficult to model the role of forests both in the physical global carbon (C) cycle and in cost-effective regimes to abate GHG. Data limits strain the capacity of even the best models to estimate marginal cost functions for forest carbon (C) sequestration. It is technically possible to obtain better information, but for institutional and economic reasons these technologies have not yet been fully deployed. The emergence of carbon (C) trading or tax policy in which forest carbon (C) storage becomes valued would strengthen incentives to supply better data, as would nonmarket regulation if it elicited a shadow value of forest carbon (C) in substituting for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. ""Geo-wiki"" may provide a short-term solution to at least part of the data problem. The ultimate solution is the development of a comprehensive forest monitoring system involving remote sensing and on-the-ground truthing. This paper briefly discusses the role of forests in climate policy and then describes data gaps, the capability of technology to fill them, the limits of institutions and budgets in realizing this capability, and possible near-term solutions.",Forests; Carbon (C); Sequestration; Climate; Policy; Economics; Measurement; Monitoring,Article,2011.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6909117102622986,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
657258,Why ignore tropical deforestation? A proposal for including forest conservation in the Kyoto Protocal,"The Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), under the Kyoto Protocol, help participating developing countries to contribute to climate change mitigation. Although the CDM allows renewable energy projects in the land-use sector, it allows only plantation projects (reforestation and afforestation) aimed at sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. Despite international debate on this issue, forest conservation projects are excluded from the CDM. Hence, a proposal for inclusion of forest conseration in the next commitment period (after 2012) of the Kyoto Protocol is proposed. Taking as the baseline average annual deforestation for the 1990s, developing countries that elect to reduce their emissions from deforestation during the five years of the first commitment period would receive financial compensation for the emissions avoided. Conversely, if these countries increase their deforestation rates during the first commitment period in relation to the average of the 1990s, the incremental increase would have to be compensated by a compulsory reduction during the second commitment period. This scheme could promote the adoption of policies for the control of deforestation in developing countries while preserving their sovereignty in defining the means and allocating the benefits.",,Article,2005.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6908760070800781,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Part 2: Scenarios and policy implications","This paper is the second of a two part study that considers least cost, greenhouse gas abatement pathways for an electricity system. Part 1 of this study formulated a model for determining these abatement pathways, and applied this model to Australia's NEM (National Electricity Market) for a single reference scenario. Part 2 of this study applies this model to different scenarios and considers the policy implications. These include cases where nuclear power generation and CCS (carbon capture and storage) are implemented in Australia, which is presently not the case, as well as a more detailed examination of how an extended, RPS (renewable portfolio standard) might perform. The effect of future fuel costs and different discount rates are also examined. , Several results from this study are thought to be significant. Most importantly, this study suggests that Australia already has utility scale technologies, renewable and non-renewable resources, an electricity market design and an abatement policy that permit continued progress towards deep greenhouse gas abatement in its electricity sector. In particular, a RPS (renewable portfolio standard) appears to be close to optimal as a greenhouse gas abatement policy for Australia's electricity sector for at least the next 10-15 years.

4851051,Climate urgency and the timing of carbon fluxes,"The current climate emergency dictates that immediate action is required to mitigate climate change, which implies that carbon fluxes occurring 20 or more years from now are too late to have any mitigative effect. Economic models discount monetized carbon fluxes, but do not include any discussion of physical carbon fluxes. To respond to a climate emergency, however, future physical carbon fluxes need to be discounted at a high rate to incentivize action today. Using the DICE model, we demonstrate that physical discounting of carbon erodes the effectiveness of afforestation and bioenergy projects that reduce emissions over time. Our analysis indicates that policymakers need to convert concerns about climate urgency into an actual policy variable, namely, a weighting scheme that discounts future physical carbon into a current - value equivalent, thereby removing incentives to delay climate action.",Discounting; Bioenergy; Tree planting; Climate change; Forestry,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6901764273643494,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
532609,Carbon sequestration in Africa: The land tenure problem,"The prospect of using tropical forest projects to sequester significant amounts of atmospheric carbon as one mitigation approach to climate change has received considerable attention. In the Kyoto Protocol, the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) aspires to make such projects viable. This article examines the prospect of these projects in Africa, and argues that land tenure is much more than just a set of variables to be changed, and that instead it exists as a prohibitive obstacle to the implementation of afforestation and reforestation sequestration approaches. Five primary tenure problems are examined: (I) the disconnect between customary and statutory land rights, (2) legal pluralism, (3) tree planting as land claim, (4) expansion of treed areas in smallholder land use systems, and (5) the difficulty of using the 'abandoned land' category. The pervasiveness of these tenurial issues mean that the prospects for successfully implementing afforestation and reforestation projects in Africa are in reality quite weak. The current project approach to carbon storage in Africa needs to be significantly realigned with African reality in order for sequestration expectations to be practical. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

These were the Roman Catholic Church, Anglican Church of Uganda, the communities of Muslims, Pentecostal Assemblies of God and the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Key resources for tree planting were good administrative structures from the grassroots level to funding provisions. Benefits of tree planting include: fuelwood, sawn timber, fruit production and provision of environmental services. Constraints faced by FBOs in tree planting include: lack of skills for resource mobilisation and tree planting, lack of specific environmental protection policy, restricted funds, lack of suitable indigenous tree seedlings, negative attitudes of local communities, inclement weather and inadequate tending of planted seedlings.

1025372,Mixed policies give more options in multifunctional tropical forest landscapes,"Tropical forest landscapes face competing demands for conserving biodiversity, sustaining ecosystem services and accommodating production systems such as forestry and agriculture. Land-sparing and land-sharing have emerged as contrasting strategies to manage trade-offs between production and biodiversity conservation. Both strategies are evident in land-management policies at local-to-international scales. However, studies rarely report the impacts of these strategies, assessed for multiple stakeholders and multiple ecosystem services, particularly in real landscapes. Using a case study from a high-priority region for forest protection, restoration and rural development in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, we analysed the potential outcomes under 10 alternative policy scenarios, including land-sharing, land-sparing and mixed strategies. We used a novel optimization process integrating integer programming with conservation-planning software (Marxan with Zones) to identify production possibility frontiers (PPFs), highlighting the trade-off between smallholder agriculture and oil palm, subject to achievement of a set of carbon, timber and biodiversity conservation targets. All policy scenarios modelled proved to be capable of achieving all targets simultaneously. Most strategies resulted in an expansion of the PPF from the baseline, increasing the flexibility of land allocation to achieve all targets. Mixed strategies gave the greatest flexibility to achieve targets, followed closely by land-sparing. Land-sharing only performed better than the baseline when no yield penalties were incurred, and resulted in PPF contraction otherwise. Strategies assessed required a minimum of 29-37% to be placed in conservation zones, notably protecting the majority of remaining forest, but requiring little reforestation.Policy implications. Production possibility frontiers (PPFs) can evaluate a broad spectrum of land-use policy options. When using targets sought by multiple stakeholders within an ecosystem services framework, PPFs can characterize biophysical, socio-economic and institutional dimensions of policy trade-offs in heterogeneous landscapes. All 10 policy strategies assessed in our case study are biophysically capable of achieving all stakeholder objectives, provided at least 29-37% of the landscape is conserved for biodiversity. This novel methodological approach provides practical options for systematic analysis in complex, multifunctional landscapes, and could, when integrated within a larger planning and implementation process, inform the design of land-use policies that maximize stakeholder satisfaction and minimize conflict.",biodiversity conservation; Borneo; ecosystem services; integer programming; Kalimantan; land-sharing; land-sparing; land-use allocation; production possibility frontier; wildlife-friendly farming,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6882840991020203,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
555393,The Role of Carbon Capture and Sequestration Policies for Climate Change Mitigation,"This paper takes the 'policy failure' in establishing a global carbon price for efficient emissions reduction as a starting point and analyzes to what extent technology policies can be a reasonable second-best approach. From a supply-side perspective, carbon capture and storage (CCS) policies differ substantially from renewable energy policies: they increase fossil resource demand and simultaneously lower emissions. We analyze CCS and renewable energy policies in a numerical dynamic general equilibrium model for settings of imperfect or missing carbon prices. We find that in contrast to renewable energy policies, CCS policies are not always capable of reducing emissions in the long run. If feasible, CCS policies can carry lower social costs compared to renewable energy policies, in particular when second-best policies are only employed temporally. In case fossil resources are abundant and renewable energy costs low, renewable energy policies perform better. Our results indicate that a pure CCS policy or a pure renewable energy policy carry their own specific risks of missing the environmental target. A smart combination of both, however, can be a robust and low-cost temporary second-best policy.",Renewable energy policy; Supply-side dynamics; Carbon pricing; Global warming; CCS; Hotelling; Second-best,Article,2015.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6882826089859009,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
1793914,Tipping Fees Can't Save us from the Tipping Point: The Need to Create Rational Approaches to Risk Management that Motivate Geologic CO(2) Storage Best Practices,"This paper explores the mismatch between the widely held public policy view of the long-term risk profile for carbon dioxide (CO(2)) storage with the emerging science and engineering of CO(2) storage. We review the key issues of fit, interplay, and scalability associated with a trust fund funded by a hypothetical $1/tonCO(2) tipping fee for each ton of CO(2) stored in the United States under WRE450 and WRE550 climate policies. Left to grow unchecked, this hypothetical tipping fee fund would accumulate hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars before it would be expected to pay out claims caused by potential damage arising from CO(2) storage. The authors conclude there is no intrinsic value in creating a trust fund predicated solely on collecting a tipping fee. Rather than mitigating the financial consequences of long-term CCS risks, this analysis suggests a blanket $1/tonCO(2) tipping fee may increase the probability and frequency of long-term risk by eliminating financial incentives for sound operating behavior and site selection criteria-contribute to moral hazard. At a minimum, effective use of a trust fund requires: (1) strong oversight regarding site selection and fund management, and (2) a clear process by which the fund is periodically valued and funds collected are mapped to the risk profile of the pool of covered CCS sites. Without appropriate checks and balances, there is no a priori reason to believe that the amount of funds held in trust will map to the actual amount of funds needed to address long-term care expenses and delimited compensatory damages.

566710,Disordering fantasies of coal and technology: Carbon capture and storage in Australia,"One of the main ways that continued use of coal is justified, and compensated for, is through fantasies of technology. This paper explores the politics of 'Carbon Capture and Storage' (CCS) technologies in Australia. These technologies involve capturing CO2 emissions, usually to store them 'safely' underground in a process called 'geo-sequestration'. In Australia the idea of 'clean coal' has been heavily promoted, and is a major part of CO2 emissions reduction plans, despite the technological difficulties, the lack of large scale working prototypes, the lack of coal company investment in such research, and the current difficulties in detecting leaks. This paper investigates the ways that the politics of 'clean coal' have functioned as psycho-social defence mechanisms, to prolong coal usage, assuage political discomfort and anxiety, and increase the systemic disturbance produced by coal power.

361221,The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme: Issues in Allowance Price Support and Linkage,"In 2008, the European Union established what seemed like an ambitious cap (-21% from 2005 levels) for the third phase (2013-2020) of the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). Ex ante modeling-which took account of the reductions in emissions resulting from meeting the renewables target and the inflow of project-based credits-indicated that this would result in an approximate allowance price of (sic)30 per tonne of CO2, which was judged to provide the necessary financial incentive to abate emissions, to support carbon capture and storage and innovation in alternative energy supplies, and to discourage member states from doing their own thing in terms of price support and other measures. The only linkage was the acceptance for compliance purposes of Clean Development Mechanism and Joint Implementation credits. But in 2013, all has changed; the allowance price is approximately 75% less than what was anticipated, a friends-of-coal lobby has emerged in the EU, and opportunities to link with other ETS are now becoming a reality.

Stage one of the CO2CRC Otway Project (the Project) has successfully injected over 65,000 tonnes of CO2-rich gas (80% carbon dioxide; 20% methane) into a depleted natural gas reservoir. An exhaustive data set of pre- and post-injection monitoring information has been collected across the atmospheric, near-surface and sub-surface domains. These monitoring results have been largely consistent with the modelling predictions thereby adding confidence to both the approach and validity of the subsurface realisations. Public confidence has benefited from this and allowed the CO2CRC to look at exploiting new opportunities at the Otway Project site that serve to optimise the existing infrastructure. Otway Stage two is based on injection into a heterogeneous formation with no apparent structural closure with the principal objective of understanding trapping mechanisms in deep saline formations. A research program has been developed adapting the ""Huff and Puff"" technique to better understand the key parameters impacting residual trapping. The key challenges faced by the Project have been both technical and legislative. These have included getting the original project approved in the absence of legislation dedicated to carbon storage and managing the transition of these multi-jurisdictional legislative approvals to the new carbon storage legislation passed by the Victorian State Government in 2008. The Otway Project has provided the Victorian Government with a valuable practical case study from which to draw learnings for developing policy and regulatory frameworks for carbon capture and storage (CCS). As the Victorian Government brought Australia's first standalone carbon storage legislation (based on petroleum legislation) into operation in December 2009, some unique insights have been identified through the Otway Project. These include an understanding of stakeholder perception through the Project's community engagement activities and more recently, on how an existing research and demonstration project could be bridged to a newly introduced legislative regime. Other jurisdictions with CCS projects are likely to find these project-based learnings of great value, particularly, in developing regulatory frameworks and a risk communication strategy. The Otway Project is currently Australia's only active storage project and in addition to performing important storage research, is a key driver for enhancing community confidence towards CCS. These are all critical considerations for accelerating commercial deployment of CCS and the Project is playing an important part in turning research into reality. We summarise Stage one of the project, capture the knowledge gained and describe the approach taken in Stage two to utilise the sub-surface and infrastructure available to address key research questions while continuing to build public confidence for CCS as a mitigation mechanism.

413581,Biochar: Examination of an emerging concept to mitigate climate change,"Biochar is a charcoal produced under high temperatures using crop residues, animal manure, or any type of organic waste material. Depending on the feedstock, biochar may look similar to potting soil or to a charred substance. The combined production and use of biochar is considered a carbon-negative process, meaning that it removes carbon from the atmosphere. Biochar has multiple potential environmental benefits, foremost the potential to sequester carbon in the soil for hundreds to thousands of years at an estimate. Studies suggest that crop yields can increase as a result of applying biochar as a soil amendment. Some contend that biochar has value as an immediate climate change mitigation strategy. Scientific experiments suggest that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced significantly with biochar application to crop fields. Obstacles that may stall rapid adoption of biochar production systems include technology costs, system operation and maintenance, feedstock availability, and biochar handling. Biochar research and development is in its infancy. Nevertheless, interest in biochar as a multifaceted solution toagricultural and natural resource issues is growing at a rapid pace both nationally and internationally. Past Congresses have proposed numerous climate change bills, many of which do not directly address mitigation and adaptation technologies at developmental stages, such as biochar. However, biochar may equip agricultural and forestry producers with numerous revenue-generating products: carbon offsets, soil amendments, and energy. The American Power Act (discussion draft) contains three provisions relevant to biochar.

Fertilise the oceans to stimulate massive algae blooms that turn the blue seas soupy green. Suck CO2 out of the air with hundreds of thousands of giant artificial trees. Store the captured CO2 safely underground for millennia. While these proposals seem edgy and exciting, they often test the limits of scientific, technological, and institutional possibility and overlook the political, ethical, and social consequences of managing the world’s climate. Advocates of climate engineering, with vanishingly few exceptions, are Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) males with superman complexes. Their views are short-sighted, dangerous, and “barking mad.” This chapter provides historical perspectives, social context, and a gendered analysis of these dangerous proposals. © 2021, The Author(s).",,Book Chapter,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6826929450035095,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
463430,Policy uncertainty and diffusion of carbon capture and storage in an optimal region,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has the potential to dramatically reduce GHG emissions in energy supply and industry. However, its high costs mean that uncertainty about the stringency of future climate policy may dissuade firms from investing in this technology. This article explores the relationship between firms expectations of government policy and investment in CCS. First, it synthesizes recent cost estimates for CCS applications in electricity generation and oil sands extraction in Canada. Second, it uses these estimates to investigate the potential impact of policy stringency and uncertainty on CCS adoption in Alberta, a Canadian province with near-ideal CCS potential. The results suggest investment in CCS, and by extension other costly abatement actions, will not occur unless governments create a more stringent and durable climate policy environment than currently exists.Policy relevanceThis paper has two novel and linked objectives, the first of significant utility to researchers and energy modellers in particular, the second to climate policy analysts and decision makers. First, it synthesizes publicly available carbon capture and storage literature and develops cost estimates for key applications related to thermal electricity generation and oil sands extraction in Canada. Second, it uses these cost estimates to investigate the potential impact of policy stringency and uncertainty on carbon capture and storage adoption in Alberta, Canada. Alberta is a test case for CCS due to its fossil resources and high CO2 storage potential, and the technology's success or failure in this jurisdiction should be of interest to policy makers elsewhere.",carbon capture and storage; climate change mitigation; climate change policies; economic models; energy models; technological change,Article,2015.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6808857917785645,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
725448,Investment risks under uncertain climate change policy,"This paper describes results from a model of decision-making under uncertainty using a real options methodology, developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The model represents investment decisions in power generation from the perspective of a private company. The investments are subject to uncertain future climate policy, which is treated as an external risk factor over which the company has no control. The aims of this paper are to (i) quantify these regulatory risks in order to improve understanding of how policy uncertainty may affect investment behaviour by private companies and (ii) illustrate the effectiveness of the real options approach as a policy analysis tool. The study analysed firms' investment options of coal- and gas-fired power plants and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Policy uncertainty is represented as an exogenous event that creates uncertainty in the carbon price. Our findings indicate that climate policy uncertainty creates a risk premium for power generation investments. in the case of gas- and coal-fired power generation, the risk premium would lead to an increase in electricity prices of 5-10% in order to stimulate investment. In the case of CCS, the risk premium would increase the carbon price required to stimulate investment by 16-37% compared to a situation of perfect certainty. The option to retrofit CCS acts as a hedge against high future carbon prices, and could accelerate investment in coal plant. This paper concludes that to minimise investment risks in low carbon technologies, policy-makers should aim to provide some long-term regulatory certainty. (C) 2007 OECD/IEA.

We use an integrated model of the country's agricultural and forestry sectors to explore the economic and environmental outcomes for 21 freshwater and climate change policy alternatives and mitigation target scenarios. The agri-environmental model estimates are then included in a multidimensional decision space framework that incorporates the risk attitude of policy-makers and uses an ordered weighting average model to evaluate potential policy pathways. We find policies that feature afforestation of marginal land are often preferred over because they provide a range of co-benefits such as carbon sequestration and reduced sedimentation and nutrient loss at relatively low cost. On the contrary, policies that only target a specific practice or pollutant are often less preferred because they fail to provide ample spill overs relative to their cost savings.",water quality; forest carbon sequestration; primary industry; land use; abatement costs,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6795338988304138,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
5229896,How can solar geoengineering and mitigation be combined under climate targets?,"So far, scientific analyses have mainly focused on the pros and cons of solar geoengineering or solar radiation management (SRM) as a climate policy option in mere isolation. Here, we put SRM into the context of mitigation by a strictly temperature-target-based approach. As the main innovation, we present a scheme that extends the applicability regime of temperature targets from mitigation-only to SRM-mitigation analyses. We explicitly account for one major category of side effects of SRM while minimizing economic costs for complying with the 2 degrees C temperature target. To do so, we suggest regional precipitation guardrails that are compatible with the 2 degrees C target. Our analysis shows that the value system enshrined in the 2 degrees C target leads to an elimination of most of the SRM from the policy scenario if a transgression of environmental targets is confined to 1/10 of the standard deviation of natural variability. Correspondingly, about half to nearly two-thirds of mitigation costs could be saved, depending on the relaxation of the precipitation criterion. In addition, assuming a climate sensitivity of 3 degrees C or more, in case of a delayed enough policy, a modest admixture of SRM to the policy portfolio might provide debatable trade-offs compared to a mitigation-only future. Also, in our analysis which abstains from a utilization of negative emissions technologies, for climate sensitivities higher than 4 degrees C, SRM will be an unavoidable policy tool to comply with the temperature targets. The economic numbers we present must be interpreted as upper bounds in the sense that cost-lowering effects by including negative emissions technologies are absent. However, with an additional climate policy option such as carbon dioxide removal present, the role of SRM would be even more limited. Hence, our results, pointing to a limited role of SRM in a situation of immediate implementation of a climate policy, are robust in that regard. This limitation would be enhanced if further side effects of SRM are taken into account in a target-based integrated assessment of SRM.",,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6793628334999084,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
772556,Fighting sustainability challenges on two fronts: Material efficiency and the emerging carbon capture and storage technologies,"Technological and regulatory responses to large-scale environmental threats, such as depletion of the natural resources and climate change, tend to focus on one issue at time. Emerging carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies that are in different stages of development offer a case that demonstrates this dilemma. This article approximates the implications of two emerging CCS applications on existing steel mill's CO2 emissions and its use of material resources. The evaluated applications are based on the mineralization method and the comparative case represents two versions of a geological CCS method. The results of the evaluation indicate that if technical bottleneck issues related to CO2 sequestration with mineralization can be solved, it can be possible to achieve a similar CO2 reduction performance with mineralization-based CCS applications as with more conventional CCS applications. If the CO2 capturing potential of mineralization-based applications could be taken into use, it could also enable the significant improvement of material efficiency of industrial operations. Urgent problem hampering the development of mineralization-based CCS applications is that the policy regimes related to CCS especially in the European Union (EU) do not recognize mineralization as a CCS method. Article suggests that the focus in the future evaluations and in policy should not be directed only on CO2 sequestration capacity of CCS applications. Similarly important is to consider their implications on material efficiency.

5144318,The one degree war plan,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to present the idea of a global crisis plan that will be demanded when global society finally decides that the climate challenge is a real threat, requiring immediate and strong policy action at the super‐national level. The authors believe that this demand will arise before 2020, and the authors hope that this paper will encourage others to improve on the plan. Design/methodology/approach: The paper seeks to achieve the purpose by presenting the first draft of such a plan – “The one degree war plan” – in rather concrete terms, and estimating (in quantitative terms) the expected reduction in climate gas emissions that would result from implementing the crisis plan. Findings: The paper finds that it is surprisingly simple to develop a plan which will reduce global emissions by 50 per cent in five years. It also seems possible to lower global emissions to zero in the ensuing decade, and then run negative emissions of 6 GtCO2e/year for the rest of the century (through carbon capture in various forms). The result, using the C‐ROADS climate model, is to keep the temperature rise in 2100 below +1°C above the pre‐industrial level. Much work needs to assure these conclusions. Practical implications: The authors argue that public awareness of the dangers associated with climate change will increase over the next decade, to the level where it is perceived to be a significant threat to global economic and geopolitical stability. The public will then demand emergency action to cut global climate gas emissions. The authors argue that such emergency action ought to be based on a well‐prepared crisis response plan that seeks to keep global warming below +1°C over pre‐industrial levels. The paper presents a draft of the crisis response plan and encourages further efforts to improve the plan. Social implications: The social value of having a well‐considered and well‐prepared climate crisis plan in place once the public demand immediate climate action from their politicians, can hardly be overestimated. Originality/value: To the authors' knowledge, no similar crisis plan has been published. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",,Article,2010.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6786273717880249,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
1097821,A report on the EMF 19 study on technology and global climate change policies,"This paper reports on progress to date - and plans for the future of - the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum (EMF) EMF 19 study on ""Technology and Global Climate Change Policies."" The primary focus of this effort is on designing alternative sets of technology assumptions and ways to represent technological progress that can be used to study the costs of alternative global climate change policies. The working group for this study includes key government and industry technologists, developers and keepers of relevant technology data bases, economists interested in technology, technological change and technology policy, and global climate policy modelers. This study includes models developed from around the world (e.g., Australia, Germany, Netherlands, Japan and the U.S.). An organizational meeting for this study in Snowmass Colorado in August of 1999 Presentations were made by representatives of each of the groups mentioned above and it was decided to ask the modeling teams to provide information on: (1) the technologies included in the model's typical baseline scenario, (2) what technologies would be employed if no new technologies were introduced after 2000, and (3) the technologies included in the model's projection of a 550 ppm carbon dioxide in the atmosphere scenario. It was also decided to look at a very broad range of technology options - at least initially. The following categories of technologies are being considered: (1) energy supply technologies, (2) energy demand technologies, (3) carbon sequestration technologies, (4) technologies for reducing ""other"" greenhouse gas emissions, (5) ""sink"" technologies, and (6) possibly even technologies that would help people adapt to climate change when it occurs. A second meeting was held in March 2000 in Washington D.C. where three preliminary model comparison scenarios were identified and three initial study groups were formed. A a third meeting is planned for Snowmass Colorado in August 2000 and a fourth fro Stanford University in February 2001. These will be developed with the active participation of the technology experts participating in the study. Such assumptions will be used by the modeling teams to try and illuminate the best ""technology strategies"" to use to address global climate change. The results of these assessments can then be compared with - or in some cases integrated with - those for other policy options.

The empirical analysis contained in the paper is based on the study of the impacts of mangrove restoration activities in the Gulf of Kutch undertaken by the Government of Gujarat under the initiatives of the India–Canada Environment Facility (ICEF) in the initial phase (2000–2005) and the Gujarat Ecology Commission, later on (since 2005). The paper discusses the importance of conservation and restoration of mangrove wetlands in the present context and the global and local initiatives thereon. It then presents the empirical case of the socio-economic and ecological outcomes of the community-based mangrove restoration (CBMR) in Gujarat and its livelihood outcomes. The paper concludes by underlying the major challenges facing the conservation and restoration of mangrove wetlands in the state and the imperatives of policy and institutional interventions in the emerging context of climate change risks and vulnerability of coastal livelihoods. It also brings out the imperative of a better understanding of the dynamics of the ongoing interventionist policies and programmes towards restoration and conservation of mangroves in rest of the Indian states, especially, West Bengal, Orissa, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh, which are at the forefront of implementing mangrove restoration activities. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",,Book Chapter,2013.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6773032546043396,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
320211,The politics of numbers in forest and climate change policies in Australia and the UK,"Forestry worldwide has a history of relying upon quantification, drawing on science and economics to compute core concepts such as the relationship between tree-based stand descriptors and marketable timber volumes. This number-oriented approach is grounded in rationalisation and sustained yield objectives that emerged in the eighteenth century and persisted throughout most of the twentieth century. With the rise of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) as a governing idea in the 1990s, forest policy and management broadened its orientation to encompass different values, including biodiversity and cultural values'. Adaptive Forest Management (AFM) has emerged as a more recent paradigm, responding to the complexity of forest ecosystems by building on systematic learning from operational practice, making space for more qualitative approaches. With the development of climate change policy and carbon accounting, the balance changes once again towards the role of numbers in forestry management. In both Australia and the UK, international politics, policy and national debate linking climate change to forests prioritise one public good - carbon sequestration - over others. The quantifiability of carbon makes mitigation more easily communicated and translated into other sectors and across levels of government, so when policy actors attempt to promote the role of forestry in climate change, its contribution to mitigation is receiving more recognition than adaption. At the sub-national level, there is a growing awareness of the urgency of adaptation, but advocates struggle with the challenges of making adaptation legible in the absence of widely recognised forms in which to express results. Our analysis suggests that ways need to be found to combine the historically strong language of number with other, more qualitative languages, to realise the full potential of forestry in climate change policy.

This paper sheds light on this issue by assessing the optimal strategy regarding the long-term use of CCS technologies. The aim is to analyze the optimal CCS policy when the sequestration rate is endogenous, being therefore one specific tool of the environmental policy. We develop a simple growth model to identify the main driving forces that should determine the optimal CCS policy. We show that, under some conditions on the cost of extractions, CCS may be a long-term solution to curb carbon emissions. We also show that over time the social planner will choose to decrease the rate of capture and sequestration. We then derive the decentralized equilibrium outcome by considering the programs of the fossil resource-holder and of the representative consumer. Finally, we determine the optimal environmental policy, i.e. the carbon tax scheme, as well as the dynamics of the fossil fuel price needed to implement it.",Carbon capture and sequestration; Optimal growth; Environmental policy,Article,2013.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6770180463790894,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

779964,Spatial and temporal variability of greenhouse gas emissions from rural development land use operations,"Climate change objectives of mitigation and adaptation are being mainstreamed into many policies and strategies around the world. In Europe, this has included the Rural Development Programme, which aims to tackle multiple social, economic and environmental objectives in rural areas, and the integration of climate change objectives adds another strand of complexity to the decision making process. When formulating policies determining the likely effectiveness of any particular measure can be challenging, especially with respect to the spatial and temporal variability of greenhouse gas emissions. This is a challenge faced by all countries and regions around the world. This study uses Europe as an example to explore this issue. It highlights the variability in emissions from land use operations that may be encountered under different conditions and time horizons and considers this in the context of policy formulation. The Optimal Strategies for Climate change Action in Rural Areas software has been adapted to derive net greenhouse gas emissions for rural development operations for all regions in Europe. Operations have been classified into five categories based on their benefit/burden over different time horizons. The analysis shows that it is important to understand the time period over which benefits or burdens are realised and determine how this fits with policy instruments, such as land management agreements and the permanency of actions. It also shows that in some regions an operation can have benefits, but in other regions it has burdens; thus, location can be critical. Finally, in the context of developing operations to meet multiple social, economic and environmental objectives, it is important to acknowledge that seeking options that only reduce emissions may not always be practical or possible. In some instances, we may have to accept an increase in emissions in order to meet other objectives. It is important that we evaluate the net greenhouse gas emissions of all operations, not just those aimed at climate change mitigation. We can then select those with the least burden in the process of developing optimal solutions to meet multiple objectives.",Greenhouse gas emissions; Spatial and temporal variability; Rural development; Land use,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6763878464698792,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
376532,Maximizing the Environmental Benefits of Carbon Farming through Ecosystem Service Delivery,"The international carbon market provides a unique opportunity to increase ecosystem services and biodiversity through the revegetation of agricultural landscapes. Although the primary motivation for revegetation is to increase carbon sequestration, revegetated areas can provide additional financial, social, and environmental cobenefits that provide different levels of private and public net benefit. Conversely, carbon farming, if it is not implemented carefully, can create disbenefits, such as increased land clearing, monoculture plantations replacing diverse remnants, and unintended impacts across national borders. Economic models of carbon revegetation show that policies aimed at maximizing carbon sequestration alone will not necessarily lead to high uptake or maximize cobenefits. Careful consideration of policy incentives that encourage carbon plantings to deliver both public and private cobenefits is required, and solutions will need to balance both objectives in order to incentivize the sustainable, long-term management of carbon plantings across the landscape.",biodiversity; cobenefits; disbenefits; land-use change; revegetation; tree planting,Article,2013.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.675678551197052,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Earth Science researchers have produced evidence that the damage function from ongoing climate change is not linear: damages rise disproportionately with global average temperature increase. This short paper explores the implications of CCC for future energy forecasting and policy. It is argued that the time available is now too short to continue framing the problem solution in terms of a shift to zero carbon fuels or carbon dioxide removal. Also, given the large uncertainties remaining in forecasting future climate—especially regional precipitation—solar radiation management is likely too risky. Instead, major reductions in global fossil fuel energy are needed, largely through energy conservation.

721046,Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage: Issues and Prospects,"Almost 20 years ago, the first CO2 capture and storage (CCS) project began injecting CO2 into a deep geological formation in an offshore aquifer. Relevant science has advanced in areas such as chemical engineering, geophysics, and social psychology. Governments have generously funded demonstrations. As a result, a handful of industrial-scale CCS projects are currently injecting about 15 megatons of CO2 underground annually that contribute to climate change mitigation. However, CCS is struggling to gain a foothold in the set of options for dealing with climate change. This review explores why and discusses critical conditions for CCS to emerge as a viable mitigation option. Explanations for this struggle include the absence of government action on climate change, economic crisis-induced low carbon prices, public skepticism, increasing costs, and advances in other options including renewables and shale gas.

5343580,A generalizable framework for enhanced natural climate solutions,"Background: The natural removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through land conservation, restoration, and management is receiving increasing attention as a scalable approach for climate change mitigation. However, different land-use sectors compete for resources and incentives within and across geopolitical regions, resulting in divergent goals and inefficient prioritization of CO2 removal efforts. Thus, a unifying framework is needed to accelerate basic research and coordinated interventions to accelerate climate change mitigation. Scope: We propose a generalizable framework for Enhanced Natural Climate Solutions (NCS +), which we define as activities that can be coordinated to increase carbon drawdown and permanence on land while improving livelihoods and the provision of natural resources in vulnerable communities and ecosystems. The framework builds on interdisciplinary scientific convergence, including critical socioecological interactions, to inform both top-down policy incentives and bottom-up adoption by industries and managers. To achieve this goal, we suggest a multi-tiered approach for the prioritization of projects at local to regional scales that would simultaneously accelerate scientific discovery and broad implementation of CO2 removal projects. Conclusions: Our vision leverages input from hundreds of researchers and land managers, including social and environmental scientists as well as representatives from tribal governments, state, and federal agencies in the Pacific Northwest of the USA, as a model system. Five guiding principles orient the framework which would be applicable in any region. As evidence of feasibility, we provide a synthesis of interdisciplinary studies that illustrate how coordinated action, with explicit consideration of system-specific technical and socioecological limitations, can lead to scalable projects with multiple co-benefits. Using theory as a linchpin for innovation, we propose that NCS + could better align climate change mitigation, adaptation, and justice goals at multiple scales. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Article,2022.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6734055280685425,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This approach tackles several critical global issues including waste management, renewable energy production, greenhouse gas mitigation, soil degradation prevention, food security, reduced water pollution from agrochemicals, and water quality and quantity enhancement. But farm level production and use of biochar is not yet viable, largely due to financial and technical constraints. Thus, an incentive mechanism for farmers is crucial for its successful adoption. This paper analyses both the current provisions and the marketing mechanisms of the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM), one of the three market-based mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol which links developed and developing countries in achieving global emission targets, and identifies appropriate marketing vehicle for biochar projects. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",,Article,2010.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6731863021850586,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1297405,Ethics of Climate Engineering: Chemical Capture of Carbon Dioxide from Air,"In the coming decades, scientists will be increasingly confronted with opportunities to pursue research with implications for one or more climate engineering proposals. Now is the time for chemists to critically reflect on the controversial possibility of managing the climate and its ethical implications. The ultimate goal of this case study on ethics and climate engineering is to promote critical reflection and discussion on the ethics of climate engineering research. To fulfill its goal, this paper will investigate four questions: (1) Why should scientists and engineers consider climate engineering research? (2) What is climate engineering? (3) What is the substance of a common ethical objection to climate engineering, the moral hazard objection? (4) How might we begin to address crucial ethical concerns with climate engineering?",Climate engineering; ethics; technological fix; moral hazard; direct air capture; Carbon Engineering,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6731035709381104,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
308231,Why are there so few afforestation and reforestation Clean Development Mechanism projects?,"Of the the more than 1600 Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects that are currently registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), only four are afforestation or reforestation projects. This paper asks why there are so few CDM afforestation or reforestation (CDM A/R) projects given the many economic, social and environmental benefits that such activities potentially offer. The authors discuss the question from two perspectives: namely the constraints to the development of CDM A/R projects and the features of 'successful' CDM A/R projects. Constraints to the development of CDM A/R projects include financial, administrative and governance issues. Analysis of the four registered CDM A/R projects suggests that 'successful' CDM A/R applications are likely to be characterized by the following: initial funding support; design and implementation guided by large organizations with technical expertise; occur on private land (land with secured property rights attached); and most revenue from Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) is directed back to local communities. It is argued that the CDM needs to be reformed to support the development of more CDM A/R projects, particularly with regards to incorporating greater flexibility, simplifying the methodological and documentation procedures of CDM registration, and redefining the role of the UNFCCC in CDMs from one of adjudication to one of facilitation.

42280,The Role of Environmental Economics in Recent Policy Making at the European Commission,"This article examines the use of environmental economics at the European Commission in recent policy making concerning climate change, energy, and air pollution. In particular, we describe economic analysis of policy options designed to help the European Union (EU) to achieve its objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent and increasing the share of renewable energy to 20 percent by 2020. This analysis looked at cost-effectiveness and emission trading options as well as equity issues. We also discuss an economic analysis of policy options for including carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. The analysis finds that CCS could result in significant cost savings. The additional costs of making CCS mandatory or using subsidies were also estimated. Economic assessments prepared for the revision of the national emission ceiling directive suggest that air pollution objectives can be met at modest costs and that monetary benefits exceed costs. The assessments also find that limiting the additional costs for poorer Member States does not increase overall costs significantly and that when limited to regional zones, emissions trading of air pollutants could save costs but might lead to hot spots.",Q48; Q52; Q58,Article,2010.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6715869903564453,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5211384,The risk of catastrophic climate change: Future energy implications,"Increasing discussion is occurring, in both the popular media and scientific research papers, about the risk of catastrophic climate change (CCC). Earth Science researchers have produced evidence that the damage function from ongoing climate change is not linear: damages rise disproportionately with global average temperature increase. This short paper explores the implications of CCC for future energy forecasting and policy. It is argued that the time available is now too short to continue framing the problem solution in terms of a shift to zero carbon fuels or carbon dioxide removal. Also, given the large uncertainties remaining in forecasting future climate?especially regional precipitation?solar radiation management is likely too risky. Instead, major reductions in global fossil fuel energy are needed, largely through energy conservation.

5276695,Public engagement in energy planning and its impact on low-carbon energy controversy,"Low-carbon electricity technologies are central to the transition to a lowcarbon energy system necessitated by the urgent need to address issues of climate-change mitigation and energy security. Beginning in 1999, policies have been put in place in the UK with the aim of facilitating the deployment of low-carbon technologies in the light of increasingly challenging deployment targets. The ever-shifting policy landscape has brought a renewable obligation, technology targets at different scales, the regionalisation of energy policy, new planning bodies and, most recently, a shift away from planning at a regional to the local scale. Overcoming issues of public opposition to new energy developments has been seen as key to increasing deployment of low-carbon electricity technologies, particularly in the case of renewables, where government and business actors consider that this opposition has hindered deployment (Devine-Wright 2011). Thus, policies have sought to overcome opposition by changing the opportunities for public engagement in energy planning. Stirling (2005) identifies three main rationales for public engagement in planning and other forms of environmental policy-making: it can result in better decisions, it may be a means of engendering support for a particular decision or it may be regarded as the right thing to do from the point of view of democracy. Engagement may be approached in different ways ranging from informing people about a decision to taking decisions collectively. Using case studies of renewable energy targets, biomass and carbon capture and storage, this chapter considers opportunities for engagement in energy planning and explores the impact of different engagement approaches on low-carbon energy controversy. © 2013 Thomas Roberts, Paul Upham, Sarah Mander, Carly McLachlan, Clair Gough, Philip Boucher, Dana Abi Ghanem.",,Book Chapter,2013.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.6690013408660889,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
1682930,Energy and Climate Policy Consideration Using the GCAM Model: Assessing Energy Sources and Technology Options,"This paper aims at applying energy and climate policies with the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) model, towards assessing energy sources and technology options. Towards reducing emissions, the model is used to apply top-down climate policy, implementing the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), as well as to apply bottom-up energy policies, implementing measures for the power and transport sector. The top-down climate policy enables the examination of ambitious emission reduction scenarios, such as the ""RCP 2.0"" and ""RCP1.0"" pathways, identifying that the energy mix shift towards environmentally friendly technologies is not adequate. The penetration of innovative technology options absorbing emissions is needed, especially beyond 2050, where major negative emissions are required to meet ambitious targets. Detailed energy balance flows, through the provision of Sankey diagrams, show the required changes from top-down perspective. The bottom-up energy policy perspective enables the formation of specific realistic scenarios in the different subsectors, such as the power and transport sectors, providing insights on the required policy changes on different energy sources and technology options, such as renewables and electric vehicles. Although our analysis does not provide a direct detailed comparison among the two approaches, both approaches provide clear signal on the penetration of electric vehicles, the renewables but as well the need for carbon capture technologies in the long-term.",Energy policy; Climate policy; GCAM; Power System; Transport Sector,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6684610843658447,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
262879,Climate change mitigation options and directed technical change: A decentralized equilibrium analysis,"The paper considers an endogenous growth model with climate change as well as three R&D sectors dedicated to energy, CCS (Carbon Capture and Storage) and backstop efficiency. First, we characterize the set of decentralized equilibria: a particular equilibrium is associated with any vector of policy instruments including a carbon tax and a subsidy to each R&D sector. Second, we show that it is possible to express any equilibrium as the solution of a maximization program. Third, we solve the first-best optimum problem and thereby deriving the optimal instruments. Finally, we illustrate the theoretical model using calibrated functional specifications. In particular, we investigate the effects of various combinations of policy instruments (including the optimal ones) by determining the deviation of each corresponding equilibrium from the ""laisser-faire"" benchmark. We find notably that introducing an R&D subsidy hardly affects emissions when a carbon tax is already implemented, thus revealing a complementary effect between these two policy instruments.

17690,Climatic change: Is the truth at the bottom of the carbon sink?,"A main part of the international negotiations on the Kyoto Protocol implementation is focusing on carbon sinks. The term of ""carbon sinks"" describes the activities related to land use, land-use change and forestry. In general, two main approaches for mitigating climate change are distinguished: the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions caused by fossil fuel consumption and cement production, the sequestration of carbon in sinks. The debates on the inclusion of carbon sinks must be replaced in the context of the discussions on supplementary in the Kyoto Protocol. Since the appearance of the carbon sink concept during the negotiations on climate change in the early 90s, the controversies have not ceased. These controversies reflect the scientific uncertainties and the diversity of opinion. Both promoters and opponent use scientific results, but sometimes with bias. Some debates are mixed up by the various definitions of sinks as physical objects and sinks as political objects. Some controversies deal with the risk of including sinks in the means for mitigating climate change. The risk is to alleviate the environmental integrity of the Kyoto Protocol. According to the opponents, the scientific basis of carbon sinks is uncertain. Many arguments are given: boreal reforestation may worsen the global change, the current sinks may become large sources in some years because of the effects of atmospheric and climatic changes, the permanence of carbon sequestration in sinks can not be guaranteed, the additionality of carbon sequestration by projects can not be evaluated, the carbon sink projects may have negative impact on greenhouse gas emissions outside their boundaries, the measurement of carbon sequestration is not efficient or precise. Some other controversies are related to the consequences of carbon sinks on environment and sustainable development, especially on biodiversity. The opponents to carbon sinks warn off the risk of transformation of natural ecosystems into man-created plantations. Furthermore, the implementation of carbon sinks in the developing countries raises some ethical questions. © 2002 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.",,JOUR,2002.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6681584119796753,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Second, conceptualizing geoengineering through research promotes conceptualizing a sorely needed technical strategy for climate change.

Research on this subject has gained a boost in the last few years, when the inevitable debates concerning global warming have created a practical scenario, applicable in the future, a daring and provocative scenario: climate engineering through two types of technologies (solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal). The objective of this article is to briefly point out the main and problematic paradigms in geoengineering. I will offer certain recommendations concerning the passage from social opportunity to morality in geoengineering, based on these. First, I will offer a working definition of geoengineering, as well as a short approach of the two types of climate manipulation, to familiarize the reader with the specificity of this research domain.

732851,The role of forestry projects in the clean development mechanism,"Land use, Land-use change and Forestry (LULUCF) has been a controversial subject in the climate negotiations. The inclusion of LULUCF in the clean development mechanism (CDM) and the rules and modalities for such an inclusion belong to the most complicated and technical negotiation issues in the history of the Kyoto Protocol. This paper examines in detail the implications of different policy decisions concerning the inclusion of CDM forestry projects in the first commitment period of the climate regime (2008-2012). The analysis is based on the development of marginal carbon sequestration cost curves which are implemented into the carbon market model CERT. The latter is a partial equilibrium model of the international market for emissions permits under the Kyoto Protocol. The scenario analysis sheds light on the role of CDM forestry projects in the climate regime, the effect of different policy scenarios on the pen-nit price as well as the distribution of benefits and losses between countries. The results suggest that the role of forestry projects in the CDM in the first commitment period will be rather small. The countries mainly benefiting from the introduction of forestry in the CDM are the Annex B countries as a whole, as well as the Latin-American and African countries. In spite of the benefits to Annex B as a whole, the hot air holding countries lose, while in the group of the Non-Annex B countries, China is the biggest loser from an introduction of LULUCF in the CDM. The comparison of benefits and losses of countries with their respective negotiating position on the issue shows that economic reasons can explain country negotiating positions partly. In some cases, however, country positions are driven by reasons other than economic interest. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

484943,Institutional incentives for managing the landscape: Inducing cooperation for the production of ecosystem services,"Agricultural landscapes hold tremendous potential for producing a diverse stream of ecosystem services. Yet, because the spatial configuration of particular ecosystems is critical to the supply of many services, realizing this potential requires that farms be managed in a coordinated way across landscapes rather than as independent units. Under existing incentive programs, this level of coordination is typically neither required nor encouraged. Here we explore how to achieve such coordination from an institutional perspective using voluntary incentives rather than regulation. We focus on three services operating at contrasting scales, from local to global: pollination, hydrologic services, and carbon sequestration. First, we briefly illustrate how agricultural practices can diminish or enhance their provision. Next, we show how all three services require coordinated, landscape-scale management because provision depends upon particular spatial configurations, of which we provide several stylized examples. Finally, based on these stylized configurations, we evaluate the relative merits of three incentive designs-the ""cooperation bonus,"" the ""entrepreneur,"" and the ""ecosystem service district""-to promote cross-farm cooperation to enhance service provision. All three incentive systems rely on rational self-interest, have cooperative configurations to promote ecosystem services across different scales, use tiered reward systems, and have a major voluntary element. They are distinct in certain key features. The cooperation bonus system rewards conservation even without cooperation but adds a bonus for cooperation. In the entrepreneur incentive, all tiers of reward are contingent upon cooperation. The ecosystem service district scheme is only partially voluntary and forces cooperation of all landowners once the district is formed. Our analysis of these heuristic alternatives integrates biophysical, economic, and institutional factors with the aim of addressing the suite of institutional barriers for landscape-scale management.

Accomplishing this goal will require carbon dioxide removal (CDR), yet existing plans for CDR deployment are insufficient to meet potential global needs, and equitable approaches for distributing CDR responsibilities between nations are lacking. Here we apply two common burden-sharing principles to show how CDR responsibility could be shared between regions in 1.5 degrees C and 2 degrees C mitigation pathways. We find that fair-share outcomes for the United States, the European Union and China could imply 2-3 times larger CDR responsibilities this century compared with a global least-cost approach. We illustrate how delaying near-term mitigation affects the CDR responsibilities of major emitters: raising emission levels in 2030 by one gigatonne generates about 20-70 additional gigatonnes of CDR responsibility over this century. An informed debate about equitable CDR contributions will be essential to achieve much-needed progress in this area. Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) will be required to achieve 1.5 degrees C or well below 2 degrees C climate targets. Analysis of equitable distributions of CDR responsibility shows 2-3 times larger responsibility on large emitters such as the United States, China and the European Union than under a least-cost approach.",,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.665058970451355,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Implications of technologies and practices for removing CO2 from the atmosphere (CDR) are not fully understood and have not yet been mapped against the full range of SDGs. CDR is widely seen as necessary to achieve the Paris Agreement's global goal of limiting warming to 1.5-2 degrees C, yet local geographical, socio-economic, and political interdependencies are often overlooked. This review synthesizes the best available understandings of potential implications of CDR options aiming to complement emissions reductions. It seeks to identify effects on and interactions between specific social, environmental, and policy environments, in which various CDR options could be pursued. Climate change mitigation and co-benefits from CDR could significantly benefit SDGs, yet poorly designed CDR policies could also challenge SDGs. Specific CDR options could generate conflicts over land, water, biomass, or electric power resources, and exclude communities from policy benefits with negative cascading effects for a range of SDGs. In the literature, implications of CDR activities on sustainable development are derived from current pilot activities, inferred from similar practices already operational or model outputs regarding land, energy, or material requirements. Important gaps remain. We identify questions for further disciplinary and inter- or transdisciplinary work strengthening understanding of how CDR could either support or threaten the achievement of the SDGs. Key policy insights CO2 removal (CDR) appears essential for limiting warming to well below 2 degrees C; such stabilization of global climate is a precondition for at least partially achieving the SDGs. CDR options can generate positive and negative local/regional impacts on various SDGs via physical, social, economic, and political channels. None of these options are universally 'good' or 'bad'. The scale of implementation of CDR and related impacts are highly dependent on policy design and national planning processes. More research is needed to clarify how policy design can allow CDR options to generate synergies between, and prevent harm across, multiple SDGs.",Carbon dioxide removal; negative emissions; co-benefits; sustainable development goals; mitigation; technology assessment,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6627912521362305,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5339030,"Playing Into the Hands of the Powerful: Extracting “Success” by Mining for Evidence in a Payments for Environmental Services Project in Matiguás-Río Blanco, Nicaragua","Payments for Environmental Services (PES) are premised upon the provision of monetary incentives to induce land-use practices viewed to be beneficial for advancing tropical conservation. A recent article published by Pagiola et al. in this journal claims that PES successfully transitioned land-use from agricultural use in Matiguás-Río Blanco, Nicaragua to silvopastoralism through afforestation and hence associated improvements in carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. Building on contrasting perspectives from peasants and local organizations in the region for more than a decade, we illustrate why viewing relations like payment provision and adoption of land-use outcomes that disregard parallel voices of implicated actors is not only analytically imprecise, but risks being anti-ecological if such a decontextualized connection is used to show evidence that tropical conservation is being advanced. We argue that the effect of payments must be contextualized with: a) increasingly globalized and expanding commodity frontiers for which PES programs may actually further advance to the detriment of tropical conservation; and b) the assumptions made in the methodological approaches adopted to determine causality. In sum, we highlight the dangers of uncritically portraying narratives of “success” to scale up investment to further proliferate decontextualized conservation projects that may not ensure long-term outcomes. We propose responding to these potential dangers through more open, horizontal, and long-term engagement on both the criteria and the consequences of defining success in tropical conservation interventions with actors whose lives are directly affected by them. © The Author(s) 2021.",,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6627042889595032,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

We study the decline of coal-fired power generation in the United Kingdom from 2000 to 2017 by analyzing the discourse inThe Guardian. We find scientists and environmental NGOs criticizing coal for climate and health reasons. Government and incumbent businesses tried to re-legitimate coal but eventually, their resistance collapsed and coal was almost completely abandoned in just a few years.

5298456,Ecologically based goal setting in mangrove forest and tidal marsh restoration,"The history of goal setting in marsh acid mangrove restoration projects is outlined and suggested to have included three phases. The first was the initial experimental phase where 'persistent vegetative cover' was the primary goal. Following the routine achievement of that criterion, coastal restoration entered a new phase where wetland compensatory mitigation became the primary driving force and 'functional equivalency' was considered the ultimate goal. We have now entered the third phase where 'ecological restoration' and 'ecosystem restoration' are the buzzwords. Using case studies in southern Florida, it is suggested that the political will is not there to properly fund effective wetland compensatory mitigation programs and thus the success of these is marginal and cannot be expected to improve. Wetland regulatory programs are still needed, but the future of coastal wetland management is more likely to be successful with an emphasis on conservation and restoration programs with mitigation:compensation being only one small part of the entire program. Ecologically based goal setting will be an important future element of successful non-regulatory wetland management programs. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

In this paper we show how collective waste disposal systems introduce essential changes in the design of optimal environmental policy. Absent collective disposal, an optimal environmental policy imposes relatively stringent regulations on polluters in regions where local environmental damage functions are ""high""; however, under collective waste disposal, the optimal environmental policy level increases monotonically over distance from the disposal site, and this is true irrespective of the degree of spatial heterogeneity in local environmental damage functions. We characterize the optimal spatial pattern of environmental policy levels under collective waste disposal and identify optimal membership size for waste disposal networks comprised of homogeneous producers.

While this has largely been driven by economic benefits for landholders, the long-term viability of the carbon farming industry depends on its ability to obtain and maintain a social licence to operate in affected communities. Using a combination of survey, interview and focus group methods, involving key stakeholders in far-western New South Wales (NSW), this study reveals that the greatest threat to the social licence of carbon farming is the lack of confidence in governance related to policy complexity and uncertainty. Procedural fairness is a relative strength because of the involvement of trusted community members, and the trust-building strategies employed by the aggregators who recruit landholders to carbon farming. Perceptions of distributional fairness are strengthened by the benefits beginning to flow through rangeland communities, but are weakened by concerns around the equity of eligibility and the land management rules. A focus on participatory policy development, aligning rules with local values and local-scale trust building, is required in order to enhance the social licence for carbon farming in the NSW rangelands.",carbon farming; sequestration; trust; equity; SLO; rangelands,Article,2022.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.6604131460189819,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0

Study of landowner behavior aids in designing more effective incentives for inducing land use and land cover changes to help mitigate climate change by reducing net greenhouse gas emissions. Afforestation, deforestation, reforestation, and timber harvest are the most frequent land management practices that influence forest carbon stocks and flux. Research studies provide estimates of how private landowners respond to market signals and government programs and how they alter land management. For example, landowners have tended to retain subsidized afforested stands well beyond program life in the United States, suggesting that similar programs for climate change mitigation could result in high rates of retention. At the same time, policy makers need to be aware that unintended consequences of policies can lead to significantly different outcomes than envisioned, including leakage possibilities.",,Review,2003.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6580864191055298,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
4926143,Fair distributions of carbon dioxide removal obligations and implications for effective national net-zero targets,"Achieving net-zero emissions at the global level, as required to limit warming to 1.5 degrees C, means both rapid emissions reductions across all sectors as well as a scaling-up of carbon dioxide removal (CDR). As a growing number of countries bring forward national net-zero targets, the questions of how much CDR each nation holds responsibility for, whether CDR transfers should be possible under the Paris Agreement market mechanisms, and how this might affect the years in which different countries should achieve net-zero, become increasingly important. Here we show that, depending on the normative assumptions underlying a CDR burden-sharing system, the adjusted net-zero date for big emitting countries could shift forward by up to 15 years (EU, based on gross domestic product) to 35 years (Russia, based on cumulative per capita emissions) compared with what is modeled domestically in global least-cost scenarios. This illustrates a challenge of using least-cost model scenarios as a basis for setting and evaluating net-zero targets. We also evaluate the potential risk of carbon loss associated with CDR transfers of such a magnitude, and consider how a discount factor could help address carbon loss risks and contribute to overall mitigation. Our results highlight the need for clear guidelines to ensure that international CDR transfers do not obscure urgently-needed domestic emission reductions efforts by big emitters, while promoting a fair and equitable distribution of the CDR burden inflicted by insufficient near-term mitigation. We find a separate mechanism or accounting for CDR obligations to be the most promising avenue to deliver on these objectives.",Paris Agreement; market mechanisms; Article 6; carbon dioxide removals; negative emissions; burden sharing; net-zero emissions,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6577941179275513,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The issue of IPRs assumes significance to India as technology transfer can be inhibited by patents obtaining over CCS technologies. This can be obviated by business partnership models that promise enabling conditions for technology transfer. The chapter argues that, despite policy concerns, sound technology transfer regimes can provide viable solutions to issues arising from IPRs, and CCS could be a commercial reality in coal- and oil-dependent countries of Asia in general and India in particular. Since financial resources are limited in comparison to potential investment avenues, the challenge of allocating financial resources to CCS projects needs to be presaged upon technical, economic and environmental assessment exercises. © 2016 Taylor and Francis.",,Book Chapter,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6563923954963684,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
241936,Viable and convivial technologies: Considerations on Climate Engineering from a degrowth perspective,"Faced with the urgency of climate change, Climate Engineering has been framed as a fast and feasible technological solution. At the same time, however, critique against it is getting increasingly louder. This paper articulates a critical analysis of Climate Engineering technologies from a point of view situated within the degrowth discourse. In the first part two approaches discussed within the degrowth debate are presented: the concept of viability based on a biophysical perspective and the concept of conviviality based on a socio-cultural approach. In a second step formalized arguments from the point of view of applied ethics are articulated and applied to three Climate Engineering Technologies: Sulfate Aerosol Injection, Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage, and Afforestation. In a third step, an extended version of the trade-off argument about mitigation versus Climate Engineering solution is discussed from a degrowth perspective: accordingly, within the current dominant growth paradigm, climate engineering technologies might lead to reduced mitigation efforts. The paper follows the argumentative turn in applied ethics and displays a formalization of arguments that can help clarify decision-making and identify the different dimensions at stake. The paper articulates arguments against the deployment of CE technologies and advances a new version of the trade-off-argument based on a degrowth perspective. From the point of view of a degrowth-based critique of technology, the only type of Climate Engineering Technology ethically acceptable would be afforestation under specific conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6560772657394409,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

527034,One scheme to bind them all? Should emissions trading schemes be linked?,"Since the inception of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, a number of emissions trading schemes have emerged that operate in and as national markets. It has been long debated whether these national schemes must be linked with the domestic schemes of other countries. Critics of autonomous schemes and linked schemes have valid arguments both in favour of, and against, linking. While linking is generally considered beneficial because it reduces volatility, sets a stable carbon price and serves as an indemnity from political instability, the same benefits can turn to its disadvantage-in that one system can borrow instability and volatility from the system with which it is linked. The first half of this article examines the economic and environmental pros and cons of linking, thereby attempting to determine whether linking adds to, or detracts from, an effective emission reduction regime.

5338164,Cost-sharing and direct payments for wetland protection,"Given the significance of wetlands for habitat, carbon sequestration, water quality, and groundwater recharge, government agencies frequently sponsor programs that permit either cost-sharing or direct payments for wetland protection as well as wetland restoration. Many cost-sharing or direct payment programs for wetland protection are designed to either restore degraded wetlands or to pay for nondevelopment of a critical wetland area. The terms of these programs will differ depending on the government entity that coordinates the program. In some regions, such as the Philippines and Thailand, intergovernmental organizations or national governments may make payments to wetland communities to participate in projects such as mangrove reforestation as part of a larger project to enhance coastal human security. These programs have secondary benefits of protecting a wide range of additional wetland functions. For those parts of the world where there are inadequate nonmonetary incentives to protect wetland systems, designing programs that provide protection through ""payments for ecosystem services"" may prove effective in ensuring long-term protection for wetlands. By introducing a monetary incentive for long-term wetland protection of ""natural capital,"" communities may be willing to forego short-term benefits associated with immediate agricultural or commercial development. In order for these programs to be successful over the long term, there may need to be legal interventions beyond simply introducing a cost-sharing or direct payment program. For communities that continue to have insecure land tenure, people may be unwilling to forego short-term benefits of using land in exchange for long-term payments for restoration projects. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature 2018.

2409762,Bearing the cost of stored carbon leakage,"Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is considered a key technology for stabilizing climate change. However, leakage of CO2 from stored carbon can potentially undermine the value of carbon storage as a mitigation option. Thus, monitoring and verifiability of CO2 storage should be encouraged through policy provisions such as accounting and pricing of leaked emissions. Here we assess different institutional and economic mechanisms for accounting for carbon leakage. Using an integrated assessment model we quantify the impacts on the climate, the economy and the mitigation strategies. Results show that carbon leakage can reduce the share of fossil based CCS by up to 35%, if it is controlled and correctly priced. Biomass based CCS is less affected. Accounting for leakage leads to an increase of climate policy costs of up to 0.4 percentage points due to increased emissions. © 2018 Vinca, Emmerling and Tavoni.",,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6547491550445557,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

However, using land-based strategies to support aggressive subnational greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets is challenging due to competing land use priorities and uncertainty in ecosystem carbon dynamics and climate change effects. We used the California natural and working lands carbon and greenhouse gas model to quantify the direct ecosystem carbon emissions (CO2 and CH4) impacts, trade-offs, and climate change interactions of two policy scenarios identified by the State of California for fulfilling multiple land use goals, including the competing goals of mitigating wildfire severity and landscape carbon emissions, among others. Here we show that emissions from desired forest management to reduce the amount of combustible biomass (fuel reduction) initially outweighed emissions reductions from other strategies (e.g. less intensive forest management, restoration, land conservation); however, avoided emissions and enhanced carbon sequestration from the other strategies gradually outweighed fuel reduction emissions. Thus, in jurisdictions with large-scale wildfire mitigation goals, practices that reduce emissions and/or increase carbon sequestration can simultaneously offset fuel reduction emissions. Our analysis highlights the complexities inherent in LUCC planning, underscoring the need for governments to begin the task now.",climate change mitigation; land use; greenhouse gas emissions; wildfire mitigation; terrestrial carbon; negative emissions; CALAND,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6542321443557739,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
312169,Designing policies to mitigate the agricultural contribution to climate change: an assessment of soil based carbon sequestration and its ancillary effects,Soil carbon sequestration has been regarded as a cheap and cost-effective way to sequester carbon until other technologies to tackle climate change become available or more cost-effective. An assessment of the social desirability of a soil carbon sequestration policy requires the consideration of all associated social costs and benefits. Measures to re-accumulate carbon in soils have ancillary or co-effects on the environment that can be beneficial or detrimental to social welfare and few of which are traded in markets. This paper discusses issues related to the development of soil carbon sequestration policies into agri-environmental schemes and reports findings from an application of a choice experiment to elicit preferences and estimate benefits of a soil carbon programme in Scotland under consideration of co-effects on biodiversity and rural viability. Preferences for soil carbon based mitigation are found to be heterogeneous and related to beliefs about climate change and attitudes towards its mitigation. Benefit estimates suggest that including co-effects can significantly change the outcome of cost-benefit tests.

1600635,The implications of land tenure and ownership regimes on sustainable mangrove management and conservation in two Ramsar sites in Ghana,"In spite of their economic and ecological significance, mangroves in most coastal communities, including Ramsar sites in Ghana have witnessed unprecedented exploitation, leading to degradation of the ecosystem. In the face of this degradation, several restoration and conservation interventions have been implemented by both government and civil society organizations in collaboration with the communities. However, these efforts directed at mangrove conservation and restoration in the Songor and Keta Lagoon Complex Ramsar sites have largely failed to improve the conservation and sustainable use of mangroves, because key issues relating to access, ownership regimes and land tenure are often overlooked. The study therefore focused exclusively on exploring these governance issues and how they influence the sustainable conservation and utilization of mangroves in the two Ramsar sites. Eleven communities from the Sangor Ramsar site and the Keta Lagoon Complex Ramsar site were involved in the study. Participatory rural appraisal (PRA) tools such as key informant interviews, focus group discussions and direct observations, as well as questionnaires were employed in generating data on ownership regimes and how they influence the management and conservation of mangroves. The results showed that the existing ownership regime of mangrove resources has a direct bearing on the effectiveness of mangrove conservation and utilization. While mangroves under individual ownership dominated at Keta Lagoon Complex Ramsar site, family owned mangroves dominated the Songor Ramsar site. Most of the existing mangrove ownership regimes (community, clan or family lands) in the area allow access to the people to exploit mangrove resources indiscriminately without restrictions/regulations which results in over exploitation and degradation. Given the weakness of effective governance regimes and inadequacy of a formal legal framework governing mangroves in the Ramsar sites, a collaborative effort between the Forestry Commission and the communities or individually owned mangrove areas that ""formalizes"" mangrove management present the best opportunity to regulate access and exploitation of the mangroves at the Songor and Keta Lagoon Complex Ramsar sites, by providing legal backing to the community governance arrangements for sustainable conservation and restoration efforts.",Mangroves; Tenure; Ramsar sites; Conservation; Ghana,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6535456776618958,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0
133376,Recent legal developments in carbon sequestration,"Carbon sequestration is the process of capturing carbon dioxide (""CO2"") emissions, which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere, and permanently storing them in geologic formations. A number of technical and legal issues must be resolved before carbon sequestration can become a viable means to reduce carbon emissions. Recently the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission (""IOGCC"") set forth a model statute and model rules and regulations, and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") set forth a proposed rule for CO2 injection that could resolve some of these issues and make large-scale carbon sequestration projects a reality. The IOGCC model treats CO2 as a resource and covers the areas of permitting, property ownership, storage operations, and long-term monitoring and liability. Certain parts of the IOGCC model rules were a basis for the EPA proposed rule governing carbon sequestration that was published for public comment on July 25, 2008. This EPA proposed rule creates a new class of underground injection wells regulated as part of the Underground Injection Control program under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Both the IOGCC model statute and the EPA proposed rule provide specific guidance on construction and permit application submittals tailored toward the long-term nature of carbon storage. Carbon sequestration has also recently been addressed on a broader scale as a component of CO2 reduction in other federal proposals. The FutureGen project was recently modified by the Department of Energy (""DOE"") from a $1.8 billion research and development facility to multiple operations that would utilize carbon sequestration technology in coal-fired power plants. Congress has been bombarded with proposed climate change legislation, such as the Lieberman-Waimer bill that proposed a cap and trade program. All of the legislation provides methods for reducing emissions thereby increasing incentives to develop carbon sequestration. Also, carbon sequestration is being encouraged through the use of small-scale experimental projects set in motion by the DOE carbon sequestration partnerships. New rules and regulations addressing the technical and legal aspects of sequestration must be adopted. Until this regulatory framework is available, development of sequestration projects most likely will be hindered or delayed.

10278,Combining bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) - A review,"Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) has recently gained global attention as a carbon reduction technology involving permanent net removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. BECCS has the potential to realize a significant capture and storage of CO2 absorbed from the atmosphere by bioenergy feedstocks, and in turn, delivers power and heat production with net ""negative carbon emissions"". This is a considerably advantageous over other mitigation alternatives, which only decrease the amount of atmospheric emissions. BECCS finds applicability in a wide range of biomass-related technologies, while being attractive from a relative cost perspective. However, its true potential has yet not been fully realised. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the technologies and issues associated with BECCS and highlight the implicated challenges related with the incentive policies based on an assessment of the net impact on emissions achievable. Further, the need for internationally compatible accounting policy incorporating all emissions generated by BECCS over its lifecycle is discussed.

686055,Forest sink plan using a carbon offset system,"In April 2005, Canada announced the introduction of new systems that could make the best use of market mechanisms, such as the Climate Fund, the Large Final Emitter System, and the Carbon Offset System, in order to achieve the reductions quota during the first commitment period (2008-2012). The Carbon Offset System has very high potential as a system able to push forward the forest sink policy, as it can help companies obtain credits for the GHG sink through forest sink activities recognized by the Kyoto Protocol (Paragraph 3 and 4, Clause 3). It also enables companies to trade GHG sink credits through the domestic emissions trade market. If the Carbon Offset; System, which fully uses market mechanisms, is to be applied in Korea during the second commitment period (2013-2017) when Korea will have to deal with the obligations to reduce GHG emissions, it will he applied mostly to the expansion of the forest sink, through active forest management activities, such as afforestation, reforestation, and deforestation - given Korea has far fewer forest areas than Canada. In this case, it will be possible to increase the efficiency of the system by designing and operating it in a manner suitable for the conditions in Korea, including issuing domestic GHG sink credits to each sink developed through forest management, purchasing the credits, or providing additional subsidies. Forest owners might receive economic incentives through this, and it can also encourage new outside investments, such as forestry investments made by enterprises as part of their social contribution efforts.",,Article,2008.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6528147459030151,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

317948,Bio-energy with carbon storage (BECS): A sequential decision approach to the threat of abrupt climate change,"Abrupt climate change (ACC) is an issue that 'haunts the climate change problem' but has so far been neglected by policy makers. This may have been because of an apparent lack of practicable measures for effective response, apart from risky geoengineering. If achieved on a sufficiently large scale, a portfolio of Bio-Energy with Carbon Storage (BECS) technologies, yielding a negative-emissions energy system, may be seen not only as benign geoengineering, free of the risks associated with other geoengineering, but also as one of the keys to being prepared for ACC. The nature of sequential future decisions is discussed; these will need to be taken in response to the evolution of future events, which is as yet unknown. The impact of such decisions on land-use change is related to a specific bio-energy conversion technology. The effects of a precautionary strategy, possibly leading to eventual land-use change on a large scale, is modeled using FLAMES (see Appendix A). Modeling shows that, using BECS, and under strong assumptions appropriate to imminent ACC, preindustrial CO2 levels can be restored by mid-century. Addressed to ACC rather than gradual climate change, a robust strategy related to Article 3.3 of the Convention may provide the basis for rapprochement between Kyoto Parties and other Annex 1 Parties.

5281109,What do we mean when we talk about the moral hazard of geoengineering?,"Geoengineering technologies – deliberate, large-scale interventions to alter the Earth's climate – present an opportunity to ameliorate the effects of climate change; an opportunity policy-makers are beginning to consider. However, the safety and efficacy of geoengineering strategies is uncertain, and there is concern advancing these technologies engenders a range of non-physical risks; in particular, moral hazard. In economics, moral hazard occurs when insured agents no longer bear the full consequences of risk-taking, and consequentially increase their exposure to risk. However, while certainly analogous, the way the term is used in the geoengineering literature is ambiguous, describing a patchwork of mechanisms of action, hazardous behaviours, and undesirable outcomes. Importantly, as moral hazard concerns are likely to inform policy-making and regulatory responses to these technologies, this unclear specification could impede scholarly, policy, and public debate. This article charts this ambiguity, documenting the range of meanings of moral hazard in the geoengineering literature. Results suggest moral hazard is used at least eight different ways in the literature, with the three most common frames being Insurance, Unwilling and Avoid. With this, we suggest that those articulating moral hazard concerns about geoengineering technologies work to articulate as clearly as possible what the problem actually is. © The Author(s) 2021.",,Article,2022.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6515134572982788,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

1002782,Strategic philanthropy in the post-Cap-and-Trade years: Reviewing US climate and energy foundation funding,"For several decades, philanthropists in the United States have played a behind-the-scenes role in framing climate change as a social problem. These foundations have defined climate change primarily as a pollution problem solvable by enacting a price on carbon and by shifting markets in the direction of renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency practices. Funding has favored ""insider"" groups that push for policy action by way of negotiation, coalition building, and compromise, rather than ""outsider"" groups that specialize in grassroots organizing. Philanthropists have also placed less priority on funding for other low-carbon energy sources such as nuclear power, carbon capture and storage, or natural gas, nor have they invested in actions intended to boost societal resilience, protect public health, or to address questions of equity and justice. But in the years following the failure of the 2010 Federal cap and trade bill, a review of available grants from 19 major foundations indicates that philanthropists responded to calls for new directions. Funding shifted to focus on state- or municipal-level mitigation and adaptation actions and to the needs of low-income/minority communities. Significant funding was also devoted to mobilizing public opinion and to opposing the fossil fuel industry. Nearly a quarter of all funding, however, remained dedicated to promoting renewable energy and efficiency-related actions with comparatively little funding devoted to other low-carbon energy technologies.

615028,Carbon capture and storage as a corporate technology strategy challenge,"Latest estimates suggest that widespread deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) could account for up to one-fifth of the needed global reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050. Governments are attempting to stimulate investments in CCS technology both directly through subsidizing demonstration projects, and indirectly through developing price incentives in carbon markets. Yet, corporate decision-makers are finding CCS investments challenging. Common explanations for delay in corporate CCS investments include operational concerns such as the high cost of capture technologies, technological uncertainties in integrated CCS systems and underdeveloped regulatory and liability regimes. In this paper, we place corporate CCS adoption decisions within a technology strategy perspective. We diagnose four underlying characteristics of the strategic CCS technology adoption decision that present unusual challenges for decision-makers: such investments are precautionary, sustaining, cumulative and situated. Understanding CCS as a corporate technology strategy challenge can help us move beyond the usual list of operational barriers to CCS and make public policy recommendations to help overcome them.

3823942,A national approach to greenhouse gas abatement through blue carbon management,"There is increasing interest in protecting, restoring and creating 'blue carbon' ecosystems (BCE; mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses) to sequester atmospheric CO2-C and thereby contribute to climate change mitigation. While a growing number of countries aspire to report greenhouse gas emission and carbon sequestration changes from these ecosystems under voluntary international reporting requirements, few countries have domestic policy frameworks that specifically support the quantification and financing of carbon emission abatement through BCE management. Australia, as home to approximately 5-11% of global blue carbon stocks, has a substantial interest in the development of blue carbon policy. Here we assess the potential inclusion of blue carbon within Australia's Emissions Reduction Fund, emphasizing issues and approaches that have global relevance. We used a participatory workshop of scientific experts and carbon industry stakeholders to identify blue carbon management actions that would meet the requirements of the Fund. In total, twelve actions were assessed for their greenhouse gas emission abatement potential and the ability to measure abatement reliably, using a combination of available data and qualitative and quantitative methods, including expert knowledge. We identify and discuss the five most relevant and promising activities, encompassing the protection, restoration and creation of mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses. On a per area basis, mean abatement intensity of organic carbon (C-org) was highest for the (re)introduction of tidal flow resulting in establishment of mangrove (13-15 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)) and tidal marsh (6-8 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)), followed by land use planning for sea-level rise for the creation of new mangrove habitat (8 Mg C-org ha(-1) yr(-1)). The avoided disturbance of existing mangroves, tidal marshes and seagrasses has the twofold benefit of avoiding remineralisation of existing stocks, plus the future annual abatement associated with the net sequestration of atmospheric CO2-C as C-org with the continued functioning of these BCE. Our approach offers a template that uses best available information to identify options for carbon abatement through management of coastal landscapes, and details current knowledge gaps and important technical aspects that need to be considered for implementation in carbon crediting schemes.",Tidal marsh; Seagrass; Mangrove; Payments for ecosystem services; Climate change policy; Restoration,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6502513885498047,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1793745,"CCS for Germany: policy, R&D and demonstration activities","While the share of renewables has been growing rapidly since the 1990s, at present electricity generation in Germany is still based on coal and nuclear energy, with nuclear power and lignite covering almost the whole base load electricity generation, and hard coal serving as the main energy carrier for medium-load generation. However, both coal and nuclear energy are facing major challenges. The future of coal in Germany is uncertain against the background of strong climate policy regulations and issues of public acceptance. In line with current legislation, nuclear power is being phased out. In its strategy for CO2 emissions reduction, the German government has identified the carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies as one of the options. Major government papers highlight the importance of further research and development (R&D) in the field of CCS technologies. German industry supports R&D activities on CCS by participating in the work of public-private partnerships (PPP), e.g. the COORETEC initiative, the GEOTECHNOLOGIEN programme, as well as by implementing CCS demonstration projects. In view of the difficulties coal has been facing with regard to public acceptance in Germany, the public acceptance of CCS technologies is recognised as an important precondition for their large-scale deployment. Thus, research on public acceptance of CCS is one of the priorities accompanying R&D on these technologies. Besides the strategy of fostering national R&D activities on CCS, Germany is actively participating in international networks and organisations dealing with the CCS issues. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

3243938,"Whither the forest transition? Climate change, policy responses, and redistributed forests in the twenty-first century","Forest transitions occur when net reforestation replaces net deforestation in places. Because forest transitions can increase biodiversity and augment carbon sequestration, they appeal to policymakers contending with the degrading effects of forest loss and climate change. What then can policymakers do to trigger forest transitions? The historical record over the last two centuries provides insights into the precipitating conditions. The early transitions often occurred passively, through the spontaneous regeneration of trees on abandoned agricultural lands. Later forest transitions occurred more frequently after large-scale crisis narratives emerged and spurred governments to take action, often by planting trees on degraded, sloped lands. To a greater degree than their predecessors, latecomer forest transitions exhibit centralized loci of power, leaders with clearly articulated goals, and rapid changes in forest cover.

Using a combination of private and governmental resources, the program facilitates and coordinates citizen groups, university researchers, the coal industry, corporations, the environmental community, and local, state, and federal government agencies that have an interest in creating productive forestland on reclaimed mined lands. Forestry research conducted by various academic institutions has confirmed that highly productive forestland can be created on reclaimed mine land by using a Forestry Reclamation Approach (FRA). The Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM) and the Appalachian region states have determined that this technology can be implemented under the current state and federal regulations. Tree planting is documented throughout Appalachia in the regulatory programs in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, and West Virginia. Although trees are being planted, the reclamation plans generally do not reflect the current technology. The mission of ARRI is to promote and encourage the use of the FRA technology in reclamation of both active and abandoned coal mine sites.

97603,Lessons from community-based payment for ecosystem service schemes: from forests to rangelands,"Climate finance investments and international policy are driving new community-based projects incorporating payments for ecosystem services (PES) to simultaneously store carbon and generate livelihood benefits. Most community-based PES (CB-PES) research focuses on forest areas. Rangelands, which store globally significant quantities of carbon and support many of the world's poor, have seen little CB-PES research attention, despite benefitting from several decades of community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) projects. Lessons from CBNRM suggest institutional considerations are vital in underpinning the design and implementation of successful community projects. This study uses documentary analysis to explore the institutional characteristics of three African community-based forest projects that seek to deliver carbon-storage and povertyreduction benefits. Strong existing local institutions, clear land tenure, community control over land management decision-making and up-front, flexible payment schemes are found to be vital. Additionally, we undertake a global review of rangeland CBNRM literature and identify that alongside the lessons learned from forest projects, rangeland CB-PES project design requires specific consideration of project boundaries, benefit distribution, capacity building for community monitoring of carbon storage together with awareness-raising using decision-support tools to display the benefits of carbon-friendly land management. We highlight that institutional analyses must be undertaken alongside improved scientific studies of the carbon cycle to enable links to payment schemes, and for them to contribute to poverty alleviation in rangelands.",climate finance; CBNRM; dryland Africa; voluntary carbon market; institutions; Plan Vivo,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6476017832756042,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

These strategies, inclusive of afforestation and silviculture, ultra-low industrial emissions, energy structure reform, renewable energy development, household emission reductions, transportation emission control, and shutdown of cryptocurrency mining, have vouchsafed China new pragmatic dimensions in pursuit of its climate goals and have established a roadmap to bide time for the future. Here we show blow-by-blow the pros and cons of these pathways to illustrate the reasons why they best serve China's long-term targets and dovetail with China's geopolitical realities. Because of the interactions between air pollutants and GHGs, cooperatively reducing the emissions of both air pollutants and climate change gases have mutual benefits and are efficacious for the enhancement of air quality and mitigation of global warming. © 2022",,Review,2022.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.647585928440094,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5336700,The Discourse and Reality of Carbon Dioxide Removal: Toward the Responsible Use of Metaphors in Post-normal Times,"There's little doubt that a variety of CDR techniques will be employed worldwide in the decades and centuries to come. Together, these techniques will alter the character and functioning of the biosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, pedosphere, and atmosphere. More locally, they will have immediate impacts on people and place, within diverse national state contexts. However, for the moment CDR exists more in the realm of discourse than reality. Its future roll-out in many and varied forms will depend on a series of discussions in the governmental, commercial, and civic spheres. Metaphor will be quite central to these formative discussions. Metaphors serve to structure perceptions of unfamiliar phenomena by transferring meaning from a recognized “source” domain to a new “target” domain. They can be employed in more or less felicitous, more or less noticeable, more or less defensible ways. Metaphors help to govern future action by framing present-day understandings of a world to come. To govern metaphor itself may seem as foolhardy as attempting to sieve water or converse with rocks. Yet by rehearsing some old lessons about metaphor we stand some chance of responsibly steering its employment in unfolding debates about CDR techniques and their practical governance globally. This Perspective identifies some key elements of metaphor's use that will require attention in the different contexts where CDR techniques presently get (and will in future be) discussed meaningfully. Various experts involved in CDR development and deployment have an important, though not controlling, role to play in how it gets metaphorized. This matters in our age of populism, rhetoric, misinformation, and disinformation where the willful (mis)use of certain metaphors threatens to depoliticize, polarize, or simplify future debates about CDR. What is needed is “post-normal” discourse where high stakes decisions made in the context of epistemic uncertainty are informed by clear reasoning among disparate parties whose values diverge.

2460101,Higher Carbon Prices on Emissions Alone Will Not Deliver the Paris Agreement,"Limiting global warming to 2°C by 2100 requires anthropogenic CO2 emissions to reach zero by 2070 and become negative afterwards; therefore, large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere is critical. We investigate the effectiveness of carbon prices in achieving the deep decarbonization needed in the power system. We find that if only CO2 emitters are penalized, increasing prices to the social cost of carbon is sufficient to achieve a decarbonized system in the medium-term but not maintain it in the long-term. Unless carbon pricing mechanisms are adapted to remunerate CDR services, CDR technologies are not deployed. Incentivizing CDR could mean that lower levels of carbon taxation are needed to meet the Paris Agreement, which in turn lowers electricity costs. However, the deployment of CDR technologies could prolong the use of unabated fossil fuels in a carbon-constrained system, therefore, disincentives must be implemented to prevent this moral hazard from manifesting. Through the Paris Agreement, most nations committed to limiting average global temperature rise to 2°C by 2100. Achieving this requires a complete transformation of the global energy system away from fossil fuels and also large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere to compensate for historical emissions and delayed decarbonization efforts. To facilitate this transition, the taxation of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions has been suggested and implemented in some countries. This will purportedly disincentivize fossil fuel use and encourage low-carbon innovation. However, whilst CO2 emissions are penalized, existing carbon pricing schemes do not credit CDR. This study assesses the effectiveness of status quo carbon pricing mechanisms in delivering the deep decarbonization needed to deliver the Paris Agreement. Delivering the Paris Agreement requires large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere. Carbon pricing schemes currently only penalize CO2 emissions but do not credit removal. We find that, in their current form, carbon pricing schemes cannot deliver deep decarbonization in the power sector, even if prices are increased to the social cost of carbon. To achieve this, the schemes must be adapted to remunerate the provision of CDR services. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,Article,,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6469892859458923,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

As the first project of its kind in Australia, the Otway Basin Pilot Project (OBPP) has faced a number of regulatory and organisational challenges while having to concurrently address public perception. The Otway Basin site with its natural CO2 accumulations and many depleted natural gas fields offers an appropriate CO2 storage site to test scientific and regulatory concepts and evaluate public response through social research. The project aims to show that CO2 can be safely captured, transported and stored deep underground under local conditions, and also monitored and verified.

In Europe, the age-old interaction between humans and ecosystems strongly influenced the cultural heritage. Yet European farmland is now being abandoned, especially in remote areas. The loss of the traditional agricultural landscapes and its consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services is generating concerns in both the scientific community and the public. Here we ask to what extent farmland abandonment can be considered as an opportunity for rewilding ecosystems. We analyze the perceptions of traditional agriculture in Europe and their influence in land management policies. We argue that, contrary to the common perception, traditional agriculture practices were not environmentally friendly and that the standards of living of rural populations were low. We suggest that current policies to maintain extensive farming landscapes underestimate the human labor needed to sustain these landscapes and the recent and future dynamics of the socio-economic drivers behind abandonment. We examine the potential benefits for ecosystems and people from rewilding. We identify species that could benefit from land abandonment and forest regeneration and the ecosystem services that could be provided such as carbon sequestration and recreation. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with rewilding, including the need to maintain open areas, the fire risks, and the conflicts between people and wildlife. Despite these challenges, we argue that rewilding should be recognized by policy-makers as one of the possible land management options in Europe, particularly on marginal areas. © The Author(s) 2015.",,CHAP,2015.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6464356780052185,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1983097,"Governance of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS): accounting, rewarding, and the Paris agreement","Studies show that the 'well below 2 degrees C' target from the Paris Agreement will be hard to meet without large negative emissions from mid-century onwards, which means removing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing the carbon dioxide in biomass, soil, suitable geological formations, deep ocean sediments, or chemically bound to certain minerals. Biomass energy combined with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) is the negative emission technology (NET) given most attention in a number of integrated assessment model studies and in the latest IPCC reports. However, less attention has been given to governance aspects of NETs. This study aims to identify pragmatic ways forward for BECCS, through synthesizing the literature relevant to accounting and rewarding BECCS, and its relation to the Paris Agreement. BECCS is divided into its two elements: biomass and CCS. Calculating net negative emissions requires accounting for sustainability and resource use related to biomass energy production, processing and use, and interactions with the global carbon cycle. Accounting for the CCS element of BECCS foremost relates to the carbon dioxide capture rate and safe underground storage. Rewarding BECCS as a NET depends on the efficiency of biomass production, transport and processing for energy use, global carbon cycle feedbacks, and safe storage of carbon dioxide, which together determine net carbon dioxide removal from the atmosphere. Sustainable biomass production is essential, especially with regard to trade-offs with competing land use. Negative emissions have an added value compared to avoided emissions, which should be reflected in the price of negative emission 'credits', but must be discounted due to global carbon cycle feedbacks. BECCS development will depend on linkages to carbon trading mechanisms and biomass trading. Key policy insights A standardized framework for sustainable biomass should be adopted. Countries should agree on a standardized framework for accounting and rewarding BECCS and other negative emission technologies. Early government support is indispensable to enable BECCS development, scale-up and business engagement. BECCS projects should be designed to maximize learning across various applications and across other NETs. BECCS development should be aligned with modalities of the Paris Agreement and market mechanisms.",Negative emissions; sustainable biomass; carbon capture and storage; emissions accounting; rewarding; Paris agreement,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6452826857566833,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Essential to meeting this challenge is the incorporation of natural capital and the ecosystem services it provides into decision-making. We explore progress and crucial gaps at this frontier, reflecting upon the 10 y since the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. We focus on three key dimensions of progress and ongoing challenges: raising awareness of the interdependence of ecosystems and human well-being, advancing the fundamental interdisciplinary science of ecosystem services, and implementing this science in decisions to restore natural capital and use it sustainably. Awareness of human dependence on nature is at an all-time high, the science of ecosystem services is rapidly advancing, and talk of natural capital is now common from governments to corporate boardrooms. However, successful implementation is still in early stages. We explore why ecosystem service information has yet to fundamentally change decision-making and suggest a path forward that emphasizes: (i) developing solid evidence linking decisions to impacts on natural capital and ecosystem services, and then to human well-being; (ii) working closely with leaders in government, business, and civil society to develop the knowledge, tools, and practices necessary to integrate natural capital and ecosystem services into everyday decision-making; and (iii) reforming institutions to change policy and practices to better align private short-term goals with societal long-term goals.",sustainable development; resilience; human well-being; decision making; beneficiary,Editorial Material,2015.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6440829634666443,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Some have argued that shale gas will play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by displacing coal used for electricity, serving as a moderate-carbon ""bridge fuel."" Others have questioned whether methane emissions from shale gas extraction lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions overall. I argue that the main impact of shale gas on climate change is neither the reduced emissions from fuel substitution nor the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas itself, but rather the competition between abundant, low-cost gas and low-carbon technologies, including renewables and carbon capture and storage.

677570,Conservation of natural resource with the application of carbon sequestration and carbon economy,"Trees and plants absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and store as biomass carbon in different parts of it. Afforestation is a cost-effective approach to assimilate increased ambient CO2, which mitigate the predicted effects of global climate change. It is necessary to create public awareness of multiple benefits and environmental services provided by the forests and thereby encourage people's participation in the conservation, protection, and management of forests. Joint Forest Management (JFM) is an approach for sharing of products, responsibilities, control, and decision-making authority over forest land between Forest Departments and local user groups based on a formal agreement. Carbon credit can be generated through carbon sequestration by plantation like reforestation and afforestation project, and this credit can be distributed to the poor people in and around the forest area through different schemes such as employment-generation, education, child welfare, small-scale cottage industries, biogas generation, etc. A major part of the earned amount by the carbon credit can be distributed to the forest neighbors who are directly dependent on forest and forest produce for their livelihood. This will give them a fresh look to the forest protection from the forestdegradation or illegal felling. Green belt or afforestation is a statutory condition for any development activities where carbon sequestration has not been considered in the concept of green belt or afforestation. This could be recommended to include and select more effective carbon sequestrated plant species in the design of green belt or afforestation for effective mitigation of environmental pollution along with reducing of regional climatic temperature for the sustainable development of any project. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,Book Chapter,2010.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6437034606933594,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

A comparative work on CCS and renewable energy technology is conducted in terms of technology, administrative environment, financial support,knowledge diffusion, and market development. Based on the specific situation and available resources, as well as accumulated experiences in renewable energy deployment in China and CCS development in developed countries, recommendations about the choices faced with China for CCS deployment can be summarized as follows: implementing more demonstration projects and collaborating with foreign nations that possess advanced technologies to improve technology maturity, to accumulate engineering experience, to drive down costs and to ensure safety; enforcing a legally binding global climate agreement that may act as a solid force to drive CCS development; building clear financing mechanisms that can increase public sector financing as well as attract private sector investment; and allowing industrial involvement in policymaking that could help develop a mutual-trust and -benefit relationship between the CCS industries. © 2014 L and H Scientific Publishing, LLC.

5343128,Why Terminology Matters for Successful Rollout of Carbon Dioxide Utilization Technologies,"To realize their full sustainability potential, carbon dioxide utilization technologies (carbon capture and utilization/CCU) presently require policy support. Consequently, they require acceptance among a variety of stakeholders in industry, policy making, and in the public sphere alike. While CO2 utilization is already a topic of discourse among these stakeholders, there is a lack of common terminology to describe such technologies. On the contrary: The present article shows that terminology in the field of CO2 utilization technologies is currently used inconsistently, and that different designations such as CCU, CCUS, or CDR convey different meanings and contexts. These ambiguities may cause communication problems with regard to policy making, funding proposals, and especially in public discourse. In order to initiate and accompany a goal-oriented and knowledge-based debate on CO2 utilization technologies in the future, actors in the field are asked to question their own choices of terminology and to assess its accuracy. Acronyms and technical abbreviations are the chief cause of potential misunderstandings, and so should be avoided whenever possible or else include a brief explanation. Consistent and precise use of terminology will facilitate transparent dialogue concerning CO2 utilization in the future.

We conducted a Monte Carlo simulation under uncertainties of firm's capacity factor (pre-tax profit) and carbon price. The results indicate that tax credit (35 US$/tCO(2)) improve economic viability of CCS in the case of favorable business conditions. Subsidies for CCS costs improve economic viability of CCS even in the case of recessions; however, the subsidy effect is sensitive to carbon price. Tax credit could be one of key policy measures as a part of policy mix both for Japanese economy and CO2 mitigation. (c) 2017 The Authors.

619979,Clean Coal Engineering Technology,"Concern over the effects of airborne pollution, green house gases, and the impact of global warming has become a worldwide issue that transcends international boundaries, politics, and social responsibility. The 2nd Edition of Coal Energy Systems: Clean Coal Technology describes a new generation of energy processes that sharply reduce air emissions and other pollutants from coal-burning power plants. Coal is the dirtiest of all fossil fuels. When burned, it produces emissions that contribute to global warming, create acid rain, and pollute water. With all of the interest and research surrounding nuclear energy, hydropower, and biofuels, many think that coal is finally on its way out. However, coal generates half of the electricity in the United States and throughout the world today. It will likely continue to do so as long as it's cheap and plentiful [Source: Energy Information Administration]. Coal provides stability in price and availability, will continue to be a major source of electricity generation, will be the major source of hydrogen for the coming hydrogen economy, and has the potential to become an important source of liquid fuels. Conservation and renewable/sustainable energy are important in the overall energy picture, but will play a lesser role in helping us satisfy our energy demands today. Dramatically updated to meet the needs of an ever changing energy market, Coal Energy Systems, 2nd Edition is a single source covering policy and the engineering involved in implementing that policy. The book addresses many coal-related subjects of interest ranging from the chemistry of coal and the future engineering anatomy of a coal fired plant to the cutting edge clean coal technologies being researched and utilized today. A 50% update over the first edition, this new book contains new chapters on processes such as CO2 capture and sequestration, Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) systems, Pulverized-Coal Power Plants and Carbon Emission Trading. Existing materials on worldwide coal distribution and quantities, technical and policy issues regarding the use of coal, technologies used and under development for utilizing coal to produce heat, electricity, and chemicals with low environmental impact, vision for utilizing coal well into the 21st century, and the security coal presents.

570745,In silico science for climate policy: How policy-makers process and use carbon storage simulation data,"Knowledge gained from computer simulations in new earth-related technologies is not limited to the scientific community itself but impacts other domains of society such as politics, business and industry, and the public at large. In general business and industry in the oil and gas business are using computer simulations on a daily basis. In this case it is using computer simulations to gain understanding of the risk of a new technology which would affect the subsurface on a large scale and hence in Europe a substantial amount of people. So far, research did not consider in depth patterns of in silico science for policy. This paper analyses how policy-makers process and use simulation data based on a case-study of geo-scientific carbon dioxide capture modeling. The empirical results are based on 19 qualitative interviews with decision-makers from politics, business and industry, and society. The empirical results reveal a great variety of co-existing perception, evaluation and use patterns of how decision-makers deal with simulations. The field work reveals that the current state-of-the-art in research literature which emphasizes an overall misperception, misunderstanding and misuse of simulation data by policy-makers is, in general, not backed by the case-study results. However, scientific simulations do leave considerable room for misunderstandings for experts not disposing on specific geo-scientific and simulation expertise. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

1867594,Sharing learnings from carbon capture and storage demonstration projects in Canada,"Climate change is one of the most important public policy issues of our time. Reconciling the world's ongoing reliance on fossil fuels with the need to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is one of our greatest challenges. Canada is taking this challenge seriously with climate change policies that include enhancing our global leadership in advancing one of the most promising technologies for reducing GHG emissions from fossil fuel use: carbon capture and storage (CCS). Federal and provincial governments in Canada are making substantial investments in CCS, committing upwards of CAD 3 billion in public funding towards seven large-scale fully-integrated CCS demonstration projects. The federal ecoENERGY Technology Initiative announced $151 million for the initial engineering and/or pilot stages of seven potential demonstration projects in 2008. The 2009 federal budget created Clean Energy Fund, which included $610 million for CCS demonstrations. The Provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia have also committed funding for demonstrations, in particular $2 billion by Alberta. This public funding will leverage additional investment from industry, for projects that will each capture and store on the order of 1 million tonnes of CO2 per year, coming on-line starting in 2015 or sooner. In order to generate early benefits from these investments, Government of Canada intends to create a knowledge sharing framework for CCS demonstration projects in Canada. The learnings from this first wave of demonstration projects should be disseminated in order to reduce challenges for the next generation of CCS projects and to build competitive advantage. This work will also support and provide input to the knowledge sharing and best practice guidelines being currently developed by Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute (GCCSI). Given that this level of information has not been shared in the past, establishing such a framework will pose several challenges such as concerns regarding the protection of the intellectual property (IP) and commercially sensitive information. Knowledge sharing will also support public engagement and capacity building programs, and it will provide an opportunity to assess the effectiveness and impact of the public investment. This paper will provide an overview and progress to date on the development of knowledge sharing and best practice guidelines in Canada.

3710985,Quantifying the potential scale of mitigation deterrence from greenhouse gas removal techniques,"Greenhouse gas removal (GGR) techniques appear to offer hopes of balancing limited global carbon budgets by removing substantial amounts of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere later this century. This hope rests on an assumption that GGR will largely supplement emissions reduction. The paper reviews the expectations of GGR implied by integrated assessment modelling, categorizes ways in which delivery or promises of GGR might instead deter or delay emissions reduction, and offers a preliminary estimate of the possible extent of three such forms of 'mitigation deterrence'. Type 1 is described as 'substitution and failure': an estimated 50-229 Gt-C (or 70% of expected GGR) may substitute for emissions otherwise reduced, yet may not be delivered (as a result of political, economic or technical shortcomings, or subsequent leakage or diversion of captured carbon into short-term utilization). Type 2, described as 'rebounds', encompasses rebounds, multipliers, and side-effects, such as those arising from land-use change, or use of captured CO2 in enhanced oil recovery. A partial estimate suggests that this could add 25-134 Gt-C to unabated emissions. Type 3, described as 'imagined offsets', is estimated to affect 17-27% of the emissions reductions required, reducing abatement by a further 182-297 Gt-C. The combined effect of these unanticipated net additions of CO2 to the atmosphere is equivalent to an additional temperature rise of up to 1.4 degrees C. The paper concludes that such a risk merits further deeper analysis and serious consideration of measures which might limit the occurrence and extent of mitigation deterrence.",Greenhouse gas removal; Mitigation deterrence; Climate policy; Climate modelling,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6417396068572998,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

This is promoted by the “4 per 1000” Initiative, a multi-stakeholder platform aiming at increasing SOC storage through sustainable practices. The scientific and technical committee of the Initiative is working to identify indicators, research priorities and region-specific practices needed for their implementation. The Initiative received its name due to the global importance of soils for climate change, which can be illustrated by a thought experiment showing that an annual growth rate of only 0.4% of the standing global SOC stocks would have the potential to counterbalance the current increase in atmospheric CO2. However, there are numerous barriers to the rise in SOC stocks and while SOC sequestration can contribute to partly offsetting greenhouse gas emissions, its main benefits are related to increased soil quality and climate change adaptation. The Initiative provides a collaborative platform for policy makers, practitioners, scientists and stakeholders to engage in finding solutions. Criticism of the Initiative has been related to the poor definition of its numerical target, which was not understood as an aspirational goal. The objective of this paper is to present the aims of the initiative, to discuss critical issues and to present challenges for its implementation.

551357,Developing REDD+ policies and measures from the bottom-up for the buffer zones of Amazonian protected areas,"A key activity in Phase 1 of REDD+-the UN's Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) forestry mitigation mechanism-is the development of policies and measures (PAMs) to define where and how emissions reductions and carbon stock enhancements and conservation will be achieved. This paper provides contextual data and information for the development of PAMs specifically for the buffer zones of protected areas in the Peruvian Amazon, sites where REDD+ has the potential to generate considerable social and ecological co-benefits. The study sites are the buffer zones of two national parks, Yanachaga-Chemillen (YChNP) in central Peru and Manu (MNP) in the south-east. Data were collected through smallholder household surveys (n = 200), covering livelihood strategies, land use practices and preference rankings of five REDD+ criteria. The findings suggest that PAMs in buffer zones could realistically achieve an additional ~10 % conservation of remaining forest and between 25 and 70 % additional reforestation of non-forest areas on private lands. The paper argues that in areas where agricultural co-operatives exist, such as MNP, these should be engaged in national REDD+ PAMs and supported by an international NGO; in areas where smallholders operate individually, such as YChNP, international NGOs may be best placed to gain local trust and thereby raise participation rates. The environmental effectiveness of REDD+ conservation PAMs could be greater in areas of intense agricultural production, yet financial and technical support for reforestation may offer the most effective avenue for carbon mitigation in these areas. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6413549780845642,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0
564735,"The environmental injustice of ""clean coal"": Expanding the national conversation on carbon capture and storage technology to include an analysis of potential environmental justice impacts","Over the past decade, the coal industry has created a multi-million dollar public relations campaign to insulate coal from the green energy revolution and the anticipated public backlash against dirty and unsustainable fuels. This campaign, promoting ""clean coal,"" has effectively shifted the national conversation on energy and climate change to situate coal as a viable clean energy source and the best option available to mitigate climate change. As the U.S. gets closer to passing national climate legislation and the deadline for achieving significant global reductions in carbon emissions draws near, opposition to the coal industry and its Clean Coal Campaign is organizing on a number of fronts. The environmental justice movement, through its leadership on climate justice, can serve as a centralizing force for these disparate advocacy efforts, bringing together students, scientists, policy advocates, community residents, and others engaged to fight clean coal and advance real green energy solutions. This article will look at the history of the Clean Coal Campaign and weigh the arguments for and against clean coal, focusing particularly on carbon capture and sequestration. It will then overview the advocacy efforts occurring across the U.S. to oppose coal and expose the fallacy of clean coal.

3791649,Taking stock of national climate policies to evaluate implementation of the Paris Agreement,"Many countries have implemented national climate policies to accomplish pledged Nationally Determined Contributions and to contribute to the temperature objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change. In 2023, the global stocktake will assess the combined effort of countries. Here, based on a public policy database and a multi-model scenario analysis, we show that implementation of current policies leaves a median emission gap of 22.4 to 28.2 GtCO(2)eq by 2030 with the optimal pathways to implement the well below 2 degrees C and 1.5 degrees C Paris goals. If Nationally Determined Contributions would be fully implemented, this gap would be reduced by a third. Interestingly, the countries evaluated were found to not achieve their pledged contributions with implemented policies (implementation gap), or to have an ambition gap with optimal pathways towards well below 2 degrees C. This shows that all countries would need to accelerate the implementation of policies for renewable technologies, while efficiency improvements are especially important in emerging countries and fossil-fuel-dependent countries. To evaluate the effectiveness of current national policies in achieving global temperature targets is important but a systematic multi-model evaluation is still lacking. Here the authors identified a reduction of 3.5 GtCO(2) eq of current national policies relative to a baseline scenario without climate policies by 2030 due to the increasing low carbon share of final energy and the improving final energy intensity.",,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6397168636322021,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Most of the devastated forests have been afforested by the large-scale afforestation campaign in the 1970s through 1980s on a national level in Korea; for this reason, there have been very few places currently available for afforestation and reforestation. Therefore, the domestic forest policy in accordance with the UNFCCC should focus on how to ensure carbon sinks through forest tending activities (forest management) with the plan, in which 4.9million ha of stand for production forest land are recognized as greenhouse gas (GHG) sinks by 2022 rather than on how to obtain them through afforestation. In addition, the methods of the afforestation,of marginal agricultural land with low productivity and the formation and expansion of urban forest have been established to overcome the limitations of forest land area where afforestation could be performed. Furthermore, the policy of preventing forest disaster, controlling deforestation and expanding forest bio-energy and the use of wood products has been performed as the measures of carbon emission source.

2116125,"A conceptual model to improve links between science, policy and practice in coastal management","The literature has identified significant barriers to sustainable management of coastal resources due to lack of integration between science, policy and practice. The social and biophysical sciences are an important information source but are often neglected in policy and practice. The literature has identified the science, policy practice gaps as significant barriers to sustainable management of coastal resources. However, there is lack of research specifically covering the interactions between the three domains. This paper aims to: a) review the literature to identify gaps and related factors or themes contributing to the science-policy-practice disconnect; and b) propose a conceptual integrated model to address those gaps and to increase the uptake of science into policy and practice in coastal systems. The results confirm that there are gaps in the two way-links between science and policy and practice. Most research (64%) is published in the science to policy area, 32% in the policy and practice area, and only four % of the research is published in the science-policy-practice area. Effective integration is inhibited by issues of knowledge, uncertainty, communication, political and cultural issues and institutions or rules and a clear mechanism for linking science, policy and practice is needed. Frameworks may help alleviate the problem but may not be holistic or flexible enough to facilitate interactions across science-policy-practice. There needs to be a clear mechanism for integrating science, policy and practice. To address this a conceptual model of the interactions between science and policy and practice is proposed. The model includes two-way connections between science-policy-practice, mediated by both internal and external factors including key drivers, facilitators, inhibitors and barriers. The model is applied to three case studies, namely: implementing international level blue carbon policy at a local level; an historical perspective on mangrove damage and restoration at an Australian state level; and an Australian example of long-term interactions between science, policy and practice, illustrating how multiple connections and interactions can occur as projects proceed.",Coastal systems; Integrated management; Conceptual model; Case studies,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.639335572719574,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

5336651,Cancel (Out) Emissions? The Envisaged Role of Carbon Dioxide Removal Technologies in Long-Term National Climate Strategies,"Carbon dioxide removal (CDR) increasingly features in climate scenarios that hold global warming well below 2°C by 2100. Given the continuous gap between climate mitigation pledges and the emission pathways that are aligned with achieving the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement, we would expect countries to promote CDR in their long-term planning to achieve mid-century targets. Yet, countries may not consider it their responsibility to contribute to the global response to climate change using CDR. Thus, a study of the respective country's long-term climate plans is both timely and vital. Such a study could reveal the pledged collective ambition, the contribution of CDR to the pledged ambition, and how the envisaged role of CDR is described by the different countries. This paper explores the long-term low emission development strategies (LT-LEDS) of countries in order to map the role of CDR in addressing climate change. We also supplement our examination of strategies with the opinions of climate experts. Based on an inductive coding of the material and a literature review, the analytical focus of the analysis includes CDR targets and planning, types of CDR, barriers and opportunities to CDR implementation, as well as international cooperation. Our study of 25 national LT-LEDS submitted to the UN or to the EU, as well as 23 interviews with climate experts, shows that national plans for CDR vary substantially across countries and are generally lacking in detail. The findings also demonstrate that CDR is perceived to be necessary and desirable for achieving mid-century climate goals, but also reveal variation in the intended role of CDR. We use an interpretive approach to outline three possible visions of CDR in climate action: as a panacea, as a necessary fallback and as a chimera. We conclude by discussing what our findings of the envisaged roles of CDR in addressing climate change mean for climate governance. This research thereby contributes to the literature on governing CDR with new comprehensive insights into the long-term climate strategies of countries.

The resumption in Arnhem Land of broad-scale land management by indigenous fire ecologists and its reframing as carbon farming' is contextualized within an historical analysis of the distinctions made between magical thinking' and rational' notions of agency, causality and cosmic order. I move from the account of Australian totemism in classical anthropology, through cold war climatology, to the theories of rational expectations that support contemporary carbon trading. Examining the entangling of Aboriginal and late-modern pyrotechnical orders, I contrast ubietous (place-oriented) ontologies of land, law and cosmic order with their Western counterparts in sovereignty, land law and finance theory. Arguing that the elder Australians possessed a philosophically coherent political economy grounded in detailed earth sciences and topological networks of economic practices, I reverse the anthropological mirror back upon the economic doctrines of the neoliberal era, which advocate the reimposition of order on the wild climate by means of a comprehensive financialization.",ABORIGINAL ECONOMY; LAND LAW; FIRE ECOLOGY; EMISSIONS TRADING; MAGICAL THINKING; RATIONAL EXPECTATIONS; FINANCIALIZATION,Article,2013.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.6376166343688965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
108290,The impact of near-term climate policy choices on technology and emission transition pathways,"This paper explores the implications of delays (to 2030) in implementing optimal policies for long-term transition pathways to limit climate forcing to 450 ppm CO(2)e on the basis of the AMPERE Work Package 2 model comparison study. The paper highlights the critical importance of the period 2030-2050 for ambitious mitigation strategies. In this period, the most rapid shift to low greenhouse gas emitting technology occurs. In the delayed response emission mitigation scenarios, an even faster transition rate in this period is required to compensate for the additional emissions before 2030. Our physical deployment measures indicate that the availability of CCS technology could play a critical role in facilitating the attainment of ambitious mitigation goals. Without CCS, deployment of other mitigation technologies would become extremely high in the 2030-2050 period. Yet the presence of CCS greatly alleviates the challenges to the transition particularly after the delayed climate policies, lowering the risk that the long-term goal becomes unattainable. The results also highlight the important role of bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS), which facilitates energy production with negative carbon emissions. If BECCS is available, transition pathways exceed the emission budget in the mid-term, removing the excess with BECCS in the long term. Excluding either BE or CCS from the technology portfolio implies that emission reductions need to take place much earlier.

This is promoted by the ""4 per 1000"" Initiative, a multi-stakeholder platform aiming at increasing SOC storage through sustainable practices. The scientific and technical committee of the Initiative is working to identify indicators, research priorities and region-specific practices needed for their implementation. The Initiative received its name due to the global importance of soils for climate change, which can be illustrated by a thought experiment showing that an annual growth rate of only 0.4% of the standing global SOC stocks would have the potential to counterbalance the current increase in atmospheric CO2. However, there are numerous barriers to the rise in SOC stocks and while SOC sequestration can contribute to partly offsetting greenhouse gas emissions, its main benefits are related to increased soil quality and climate change adaptation. The Initiative provides a collaborative platform for policy makers, practitioners, scientists and stakeholders to engage in finding solutions. Criticism of the Initiative has been related to the poor definition of its numerical target, which was not understood as an aspirational goal. The objective of this paper is to present the aims of the initiative, to discuss critical issues and to present challenges for its implementation.

1712768,CO2 reduction strategies in the basic metals industry: A systems approach,"This paper discusses the results of a Western European energy and materials systems engineering study that analyses the impact of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction on the future of the steel and aluminum industry. The technology selection will be significantly affected by future CO2 policies. The availability of CO2 removal and storage technology and the social acceptance of this strategy for GHG emission reduction is of key importance for the strategy selection. The use of coal based smelting reduction technologies is optimal in case of weak CO2 policies or in case of strong CO2 policies and low CO2 removal and storage costs. The selection of CCF or Corex technology depends on the penalty regime. However, if CO2 removal proves to be problematic, CCF development fails and strong CO2 policies are introduced, the gas based DRI production processes will become more attractive. In both cases, the energy efficiency of the iron and steel industry will further increase in the next decades. The impact of GHG emission reduction on aluminum prices and aluminum use can be significant. However contrary to common notions the aluminum production will be positively affected by GHG emission reduction, notwithstanding the currently high emissions in aluminum production. A combination of emission mitigation in production and significant GHG emission reduction effects further down the product chain cause this effect. A significant potential exists for improved materials efficiency. This potential is generally neglected in energy efficiency and CO2 reduction studies. However improved steel qualities are of similar importance for CO2 emission reduction as increased energy efficiency. It remains to see if this potential will be used to its full extent in the next decades. Model calculations indicate that the impact of CO2 policies on the competition with other materials will be limited. Greenhouse gas emission mitigation will have much more impact on materials production and waste handling than on materials consumption.",,Proceedings Paper,1999.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6355871558189392,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
1867448,Carbon Capture & Storage in power generation and wind energy: flexibility and reliability issues in scenarios for Northwest Europe,"The Netherlands is both heavily dependent on the success of carbon capture and storage (CCS) and renewable electricity for its decarbonisation policy. The same holds for the EU and some of its Member States like the United Kingdom. This paper discusses several scenarios for the Netherlands within the context of a liberalised and a more and more connected energy market in Northwest-Europe. The research reported here shows that CCS on new coal fired power plants does not pose a threat to the increase in the electricity production by large quantities of wind energy in the electricity system, and vice versa. For renewable energy, several additional policies are in place mainly in the form of financial support as long as these renewable options are not yet profitable. For CCS, financial support is only granted now for a selection of the first demonstration projects now planned in the EU. It is not yet clear if large scale CCS and high shares of wind energy can be incorporated in a balanced way in the electricity system. This paper shows that from a technical and economic point of view, there is room for both, and under which conditions such a two fold growth will be feasible.

335988,Relating R&D and investment policies to CCS market diffusion through two-factor learning,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has the potential to play a major role in the stabilization of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. To develop the capture technology from its current demonstration phase towards commercial maturity, significant funding is directed to CCS, such as the EU's (sic)4.5 bn NER300 fund. However, we know little about how this funding relates to market diffusion of CCS. This paper addresses that question. We initially review past learning effects from both capacity installations and R&D efforts for a similar technology using the concept of two-factor learning. We apply the obtained learning-by-doing and learning-by-searching rates to CCS in the electricity market model HECTOR, which simulates 19 European countries hourly until 2040, to understand the impact of learning and associated policies on CCS market diffusion. We evaluate the effectiveness of policies addressing learning-by-doing and learning-by-searching by relating the policy budget to the realized CCS capacity and find that, at lower policy cost, both methods are about equally effective. At higher spending levels, policies promoting learning-by-doing are more effective. Overall, policy effectiveness increases in low CO2 price scenarios, but the CO2 price still remains the key prerequisite for the economic competitiveness, even with major policy support.

250888,Potential to sequester carbon in Canadian forests: some economic considerations,"Examines the potential role of reforestation policies in reducing Canada's contribution to atmospheric CO2. The results indicate sequestering carbon by reforestation of forestlands may be a cost-effective means for Canada to offset domestic emissions of CO2 from other sources, and that planting forests on marginal agricultural lands also warrants consideration. We find that reforestation is more costly than policies to increase the fuel efficiency of automobiles, but economically more efficient than converting vehicles to natural gas. Finally, we demonstrate that, because of its vast forests, Canada is a net carbon sink. -from Authors",,JOUR,1992.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6336756944656372,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
233479,Effectiveness and legitimacy of forest carbon standards in the OTC voluntary carbon market,"In recent years, the voluntary over-the-counter (OTC) carbon market has reached a significant market volume. It is particularly interesting for forest mitigation projects which are either ineligible in compliance markets or confronted with a plethora of technical and financial hurdles and lacking market demand. As the OTC market is not regulated, voluntary standards have been created to secure the social and environmental integrity of the traded mitigation projects and thus to ensure the quality of the resulting carbon credits. Building on a theoretical efficiency-legitimacy framework, this study aims to identify and analyse the characteristics and indicators that determine the efficiency and organisational legitimacy of standards for afforestation/reforestation carbon projects.Results: All interviewed market actors consider third-party certification and standards as a crucial component of market functionality, which provide quality assurance mechanisms that reduce information asymmetries and moral hazard between the actors regarding the quality of carbon credits, and thus reduce transaction costs. Despite this development, the recent evolution of many new and differing standards is seen as a major obstacle that renders it difficult for project developers and buyers to select an appropriate standard. According to the interviewed experts the most important legitimating factors of standards are assurance of a sufficient level of quality of carbon credits, scientifically substantiated methodological accounting and independent third-party verification, independence of standard bodies, transparency, wide market acceptance, back-up of the wider community including experts and NGOs, rigorous procedures, and the resemblance to the Afforestation/Reforestation (A/R) CDM due to its international policy endorsements. In addition, standards must provide evidence that projects contribute to a positive social and environmental development, do no harm as a minimum requirement and build a strong track record of successful projects. Project developers require clear, easily and practically applicable standards at lowest possible costs with a high potential in order to achieve good carbon prices, while buyers require that standards are legitimate, credible and that no public criticism arises when carbon credits are purchased from projects certified by a certain standard.Conclusions: Despite the fragmented and immature state of the OTC market, standards act as 'market-making' intermediaries and contribute to the quality and transparency of the OTC market. However, the variety of different standards imposes new hurdles for their efficiency and often creates confusion instead of confidence among potential buyers. Despite the lacking legitimacy of the standards, pressures from the institutional environment on standards ensure a minimum quality of carbon credits (including positive social and environmental impacts of carbon credits) that serves as an insurance mechanism for the integrity of standards. Its unregulated nature and the pressure from an increasingly competitive environment provides innovative space to deliver efficient certification procedures without imposing unreasonably high transaction costs on market actors. Furthermore, voluntary standards imply a more innovative certification approach, as one legal authority could do, because standards have to compete for adopters backed by civil society organisations. Thereby, the forest sector in OTC voluntary market bears great opportunities to provide the forest sector with crucial lessons for international climate policy and governmental institutions when designing regulation for forest regulation such as international and national REDDplus schemes. © 2011 Merger and Pistorius; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",afforestation; carbon balance; certification; civil society; clean development mechanism; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental policy; forest ecosystem; forest management; innovation; institutional framework; international law; nongovernmental organization; price dynamics; reforestation; social impact; standard (regulation); transaction cost; voluntary approach,Journal Article,2011.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6335908770561218,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

We compiled a transdisciplinary team of experts to elucidate these challenges and identify a way forward. Key actions to enhance blue carbon as a natural climate solution include improving policy and legal arrangements to ensure equitable sharing of benefits; improving stewardship by incorporating indigenous knowledge and values; clarifying property rights; improving financial approaches and accounting tools to incorporate co-benefits; developing technological solutions for measuring blue carbon sequestration at low cost; and resolving knowledge gaps regarding blue carbon cycles.

This assumption has been criticised in the climate policy literature for being unfeasible and unjust. This article asks how critical scholars can make sense of, and contribute to these debates. It suggests that negative emissions can be conceived of as a spatiotemporal fix that promises to defer the devaluation of fixed capital. But the negative emissions example also challenges us to broaden our conception of how the socioecological contradictions of capitalism can be ""fixed"". I outline three ways in which it does this by highlighting the significance of a predominantly temporal fix, the role of hegemonic, sociopolitical interventions involving multiple actors, and the possibility of safeguarding existing production processes.

The environmental impact assessment (EIA) experience of Shenhua Ordos Coal-to-Liquid (CTL) Project and PetroChina Jilin Oil Field enhanced oil recovery (EOR) is subsequently analyzed in light of our field investigation, and gaps in current EIA guidelines that are applicable to CO2 geological storage projects are identified. It is found that there are no specific environmental risk regulations suitable for CO2 storage in China, and environmental risk management lags behind the development of CCS technology, which presents a challenge to demonstration enterprises in terms of assessing environmental risk. One major challenge is the overestimation or underestimation of this risk on the part of the enterprise, and another is a lack of applicable regulations for government sectors to supervise the risk throughout CCS projects.

Here we demonstrate that Sweden's land sink, which is critical in order to achieve zero net emissions by 2045 and negative emissions thereafter, is reduced to less than half when accounting for emissions from wetlands, lakes and running waters. This should have implications for the development of Sweden's mitigation policy.

In this research, with the aim of providing a more reliable basis for policy making concerning ports, we proposed the carbon storage through stable containment of organic carbon present in dredged soil as a new climate change countermeasure in ports. Furthermore, it was revealed through scenario analysis that the containment effect through beneficial utilization of dredged soil as foundation materials for blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) and carbon storage by BCEs have significant meanings for the realization of CNPs and sinks for the residual emissions, considering the necessity to promote dredging projects for the development of the next generation of import bases toward the realization of CNPs, which may result in the generation of a large amount of dredged soil. In a country like Japan, whose port policies and port governance make it difficult to actively promote climate change countermeasures by each port, the feasibility of these new countermeasures would depend on the government's initiative.

As a way of responding to both adaptation and mitigation challenges within the industry, this article examines how community-based climate change adaptation initiatives might provide mitigation outcomes in the agriculture sector in Timor-Leste. Beginning with an exploration of nation-wide institutional responses to climate change, the study utilises interviews, field observations and document analysis to examine an extensive community-based adaptation program in two districts in Timor-Leste focused on increasing the resilience of the agriculture sector and the livelihoods of poor rural farmers. Analysis of this program reveals a largely synergistic relationship between adaptation measures focused on land and water management and agriculture and their corresponding greenhouse gas mitigation potential, including co-benefits such as soil/atmospheric carbon sequestration, reduced emissions, soil nitrification and reduced use of inorganic fertilisers.

It is difficult to determine whether the prospect of NETs is significantly deterring or delaying timely action to cut emissions. This paper sets out a novel theoretical perspective to this challenge, enabling analysis that accounts for interactions between technologies, society and political and economic power. The paper argues that, seen in this light, the scope of NETs to substitute for mitigation may be easily exaggerated, and thus that the risk of harm from mitigation deterrence should be taken seriously. Technical summary. This paper offers a new theoretical perspective on the risk that geoengineering interventions might deter or delay mitigation (previously typically described as moral hazard). Drawing on a brief review of mitigation deterrence (MD) in solar geoengineering, it suggests a novel analytical viewpoint going beyond and contrasting with the methodological individualist, managerialist and economist analyses common in the literature. Three distinct registers to assist identification and interpretation of situations and processes through which MD might arise are elaborated and compared. The paper shows that moving from a realist register via a cultural register to a cultural political economy register, makes it clearer how and why misperceived substitutability (between negative emissions technologies (NETs) and mitigation) and narrow climate policy goals matter for MD. We have also identified several plausible mechanisms for MD under a neoliberal political regime. The paper argues that MD cannot be overcome simply by better informing decision makers (the 'realist' response), or even by opening up the standard techno-economic framing of climate change and our responses (the 'cultural' response). The paper also concludes that the entire political regime that has evolved alongside specific economic interests is implicated in MD, and that the likelihood and significance of MD probably remain underappreciated and understudied.",climate geoengineering; cultural political economy; mitigation deterrence; moral hazard; negative emissions technologies,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6263042688369751,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5337631,A two-step carbon pricing scheme enabling a net-zero and net-negative CO 2 -emissions world,"This contribution introduces a novel carbon pricing system and illustrates its benefits. The system is based on two related but distinct ideas. First, we group the global pools of carbon into three aggregate pools, and we tax or credit human-caused carbon fluxes across the boundaries of the pools. Second, we base the tax or credit solely on physical movements of carbon between pools; hence, the system uses a physical baseline instead of a behavioral baseline based on the hypothetical emissions levels that would have arisen absent the carbon price. The proposed system goes beyond the limitations of current carbon pricing schemes for a number of reasons: it is designed to capture all positive and negative emissions based purely on their climate impact, allowing a broader scope and more appropriate incentives than current systems; it avoids creating bad incentives, particularly those caused by additionality requirements found in carbon offset systems; it captures the complexity of carbon movements through human and natural systems; it reduces measurement errors; and it provides transparent and easily observed price signals. Though this manuscript is conceptual in nature and refrains from discussing the technicalities related to the implementation of the proposed carbon pricing system, we trust that it may contribute to the development of policies enabling a net-zero and net-negative CO2-emissions world. © 2022, The Author(s).",,Article,2022.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6258773803710938,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
166598,Climate change and biodiversity: Research and policy issues in sustainable forestry in Malaysia,"With more than half the country clad in forests, Malaysia practices sustainable forest management that will not put at risk environmental stability and ecological balance. However, over the last three decades, Malaysia.s natural forest was reduced by about 20%, mainly in conversion to the agro-based industries which is a substantial contributor to the economy of the country. Such development has caused Malaysia to emit 7.5tCO2 per capita in 2004: 0.6% of the world total. Malaysia.s ratification of UNFCCC &amp; KP and UNCBD signifies its commitment in addressing climate change and bio-diversity. Malaysia.s best practices approach to carbon conservation and sequestration, and carbon substitution has been able to curb the rate of increase in atmospheric CO2. Malaysia has stated that the priority in the fight against climate change should be the reduction of emissions at source and that sinks should play only a transitional role. It continues to emphasize the importance of sustainable management of existing sinks and reservoirs. On the other hand, LULUCF activities should promote the long-term sustainable management of forests and its bio-diversity. CDM and REDD are mechanisms intended respectively to reduce emissions through afforestation and reforestation and by reducing deforestation rates and managing forest degradation in ways that minimize GHG emissions. Malaysia with relatively large areas of forests supports global efforts to curb deforestation and to provide incentives for reducing deforestation and degradation, but such approach must consider the issues of leakage, permanence and additionality, and recognizes its socio-economic impacts. Among the key initiatives taken by the Malaysia government in the fight against global warming had been in the fields of renewable energy. This paper further identifies Malaysia.s strategic directions to climate change and biodiversity under the aegis of sustainable forestry based on Emission Reduction Effectiveness (ERE).",,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6258034706115723,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

From an economic point of view, van der Zwaan and Gerlagh (2009) suggest that CCS remains a valuable option even with CO2 leakage rate as high as of a few % per year.

3782483,Is bio-energy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) feasible? The contested authority of integrated assessment modeling,"How are novel energy, technology, and land-use systems strategies for limiting climate change judged to be 'feasible'? Controversy has arisen around the research community behind integrated assessment modeling (IAM) scenarios used in the Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This regards the role played by an unproven component in projected energy systems-a coupling of bioenergy generation with carbon capture and storage techniques (BECCS)-that allows IAMs to achieve ambitious temperature targets since adopted by the Paris Agreement. We engage members of the IAM community and a multidisciplinary range of critical experts to interrogate how the 'feasibility' of BECCS-or other novel technologies-is assessed within modeling, and use 'boundary work' to show how the kind of expertise-and by extension, the authority-held by the IAM community is being challenged. We find that the competing judgments of BECCS's feasibility, between the IAM community and its critics, reflect and reinforce different understandings of the freedom of scientific inquiry, the mutual influences of science and policy, the shape of science communication, and the necessity of reform. We ask what these claims signal for future activity in this space, and conclude with a call for 'reflexive' modeling approaches to bridge perspectives.",Feasibility; Bioenergy carbon capture and storage; Integrated assessment modeling; Scientific assessment; Boundary work; Authority,Article,2020.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.6247580647468567,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1251241,Viable and convivial technologies: Considerations on Climate Engineering from a degrowth perspective,"Faced with the urgency of climate change, Climate Engineering has been framed as a fast and feasible technological solution. At the same time, however, critique against it is getting increasingly louder. This paper articulates a critical analysis of Climate Engineering technologies from a point of view situated within the degrowth discourse. In the first part two approaches discussed within the degrowth debate are presented: the concept of viability based on a biophysical perspective and the concept of conviviality based on a socio-cultural approach. In a second step formalized arguments from the point of view of applied ethics are articulated and applied to three Climate Engineering Technologies: Sulfate Aerosol Injection, Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage, and Afforestation. In a third step, an extended version of the trade-off argument about mitigation versus Climate Engineering solution is discussed from a degrowth perspective: accordingly, within the current dominant growth paradigm, climate engineering technologies might lead to reduced mitigation efforts. The paper follows the argumentative turn in applied ethics and displays a formalization of arguments that can help clarify decision-making and identify the different dimensions at stake. The paper articulates arguments against the deployment of CE technologies and advances a new version of the trade-off-argument based on a degrowth perspective. From the point of view of a degrowth-based critique of technology, the only type of Climate Engineering Technology ethically acceptable would be afforestation under specific conditions.

5259464,The Effectiveness of Financial Incentives for Addressing Mangrove Loss in Northern Vietnam,"This paper analyzes the effectiveness of existing financial incentives for mangrove conservation in Vietnam. Current conservation programs and projects have created financial incentives for mangrove protection, but the effectiveness of these incentives in addressing mangrove loss in northern Vietnam has been mixed. While financial incentives have contributed to a larger area of planted mangroves, their effectiveness is hampered by contradictory national policies, which encourage mangrove conservation on the one hand, and aquaculture expansion in mangrove areas on the other, thus making it difficult to address mangrove deforestation and degradation effectively. Mangrove conservation in Vietnam is challenged further by inequitable distribution of power and benefits, difficulties accessing information, weak law enforcement, lack of compliance, low payments for protecting mangroves, lack of full recognition of local rights, discontinued funding after policies and projects end, and lack of participation by local people in policy and project design and implementation. Conservation policies and projects should aim to protect existing mangrove forests, restore degraded mangroves and plant new ones to enhance mangrove area, quality and biodiversity. Sustainable mangrove conservation not only requires effective and sustainable financial incentives, but other enabling conditions such as addressing the conflict between mangrove conservation and aquaculture expansion, and grounding mangrove conservation projects by building on local knowledge and leadership. As these drivers are often motivated by national development goals and other sectoral development needs with ministries competing for budgets and influence, holistic land-use planning needs to be coupled with effective coordination and clarification of responsibilities between government agencies, and coordinated and consistent policies concerning these natural resources. Addressing these underlying governance issues is far more important for mangrove conservation and restoration than merely offering financial incentives as various national and international projects have attempted.",mangrove; Vietnam; deforestation; financial; incentive,Article,2022.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6243675351142883,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
820953,Eighty percent reduction scenario in Japan,"Toward the achievement of the 2 °C target, Japan has set several GHG mitigation targets after ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. In 2008, in order to discuss the GHG mitigation target in 2020 at COP15 held in Copenhagen, the committee on the mid- and long-term target in Japan was organized at the Cabinet Secretariat. At that discussion, the proposed six options were quantified, and finally, 15 % reduction in compared with 2005 level was selected as a target. Because of the change of government, the new mitigation target in 2020, 25 % reduction compared to 1990, was announced at the United Nations Climate Change Summit in 2009. Then, the road maps to achieve this 25 % reduction target were quantified at the Central Environment Council. But just after they completed the road maps to achieve the target, the Great East Japan Earthquake and Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant accident happened on March 11, 2011. Due to the nuclear power accident, the GHG mitigation road map and the future energy mix should be reconsidered. In 2012, the Energy and Environment Council forecasted that the GHG emissions in 2020 would be 5-9 % reduction compared to the 1990 level in the case of the prudent economic growth case. After the change of government again, at the COP19 of UNFCCC in Warszawa in 2013, the new GHG mitigation target in 2020 was announced to be 3.8 % reduction compared to the 2005 level under the assumption of the no nuclear power supply. And in 2015, the mitigation target in 2030 was proposed to 1.042 GtCO2, that is, 26.0 % reduction compared to the 2013 level. On the other hand, in the 4th Environmental Basic Plan endorsed by the Cabinet in 2012, the 80% reduction of the GHG emissions was written clearly. In this paper, in order to assess the feasibility of this 2050 target, we utilized the AIM/Enduse to disaggregate Japan into 10 regions. The treated technologies include renewable energy technologies, carbon capture and storage (CCS), and energy-saving technologies. The study shows that it is feasible to achieve 80 % emission reduction in Japan even without nuclear power. The impact of nuclear phaseout as compared to the illustrative scenario is relatively small in the long term because of the small share of nuclear energy in 2050 in any case. Achieving long-term emission reduction target proves to be still feasible with substantial increase of renewable energy, particularly solar PV and wind power. The share of renewable energy in electricity supply reaches approximately 85 % in 2050, and variable renewable energies account for about 63 % in electricity generation in 2050, hence imposing a further challenge for integration into the electricity system. The feature of mitigation target in Japan is mainly based on the bottom-up approach. That is to say, the process stressed the feasibility of the target. On the other hand, the top-down decision is also requested for the ambitious reduction target. Toward the achievement of 2 °C target, taking actions with the long-term perspective becomes more important. © The Author(s) 2016.

5299117,Exploring Spatiotemporal Variation of Carbon Storage Driven by Land Use Policy in the Yangtze River Delta Region,"Land use/land cover (LULC) change driven by land use policy always leads to dramatic change in carbon storage and sequestration, especially in a rapidly urbanizing region. However, few studies explored the influences of land use polices on carbon storage and sequestration in a rapidly urbanizing region. Through Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, the spatial-temporal pattern of carbon storage altered by LULC transformation and its linkage with land use policies were analyzed in five periods (1990-1995, 1995-2000, 2000-2005, 2000-2010, 2010-2015) in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) Region. The results indicated that: (1) the carbon storage in the YRD was substantially altered by continuous LULC transformation, totally decreased by 1.49 x 10(7) Mg during 1990-2015. (2) The total amount of carbon storage increased from 2.91 x 10(9) Mg in 1990 to 2.95 x 10(9) Mg in 1995, and then decreased to 2.90 x 10(9) Mg in 1995-2015. Thus, the total economic value of carbon storage increased approximately from 467.42 million dollars in 1990 to 472.99 million dollars in 1995, and then decreased to 465.01 million dollars in 2015. (3) The carbon storage and sequestration were influenced by LULC transformation driven by land use policies in five periods: large areas of grassland converted to woodland in 1990-1995 led by Forest Law, then clustered areas of cropland converted to built-up land in 1995-2015 around large cities of YRD Region led by Land Management Law and Development Plans, and finally, the conversion of cropland to built-up land was decreased and scattered in the entire region influenced by land use polices led by early stage of ecocivilization construction.

1971099,"A conceptual model to improve links between science, policy and practice in coastal management","The literature has identified significant barriers to sustainable management of coastal resources due to lack of integration between science, policy and practice. The social and biophysical sciences are an important information source but are often neglected in policy and practice. The literature has identified the science, policy practice gaps as significant barriers to sustainable management of coastal resources. However, there is lack of research specifically covering the interactions between the three domains. This paper aims to: a) review the literature to identify gaps and related factors or themes contributing to the science-policy-practice disconnect; and b) propose a conceptual integrated model to address those gaps and to increase the uptake of science into policy and practice in coastal systems. The results confirm that there are gaps in the two way-links between science and policy and practice. Most research (64%) is published in the science to policy area, 32% in the policy and practice area, and only four % of the research is published in the science-policy-practice area. Effective integration is inhibited by issues of knowledge, uncertainty, communication, political and cultural issues and institutions or rules and a clear mechanism for linking science, policy and practice is needed. Frameworks may help alleviate the problem but may not be holistic or flexible enough to facilitate interactions across science-policy-practice. There needs to be a clear mechanism for integrating science, policy and practice. To address this a conceptual model of the interactions between science and policy and practice is proposed. The model includes two-way connections between science-policy-practice, mediated by both internal and external factors including key drivers, facilitators, inhibitors and barriers. The model is applied to three case studies, namely: implementing international level blue carbon policy at a local level; an historical perspective on mangrove damage and restoration at an Australian state level; and an Australian example of long-term interactions between science, policy and practice, illustrating how multiple connections and interactions can occur as projects proceed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.622818112373352,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
337066,Current status and future prospects for carbon forestry in Australia,"Carbon forestry is part of a suite of land-based activities that can be used to mitigate carbon emissions, and also provide a range of other environmental co-benefits. Components are included in the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011. There is large divergence in Australian estimates of the areas of land that may be used for carbon forests and there has been a vigorous public debate about carbon forestry, partly based on concerns about displacement of food-producing land. We identify four distinct afforestation or reforestation (AR) activities that involve carbon mitigation and suggest a terminology based on these. These are (1) 'plantations' that also produce timber and wood products, (2) 'carbon-focused' sinks, (3) 'environmental' or natural resource management plantings and (4) 'bioenergy' plantings for use either as a feedstock for stationary energy production or transport fuels. After accounting for AR projects established for other purposes (e. g. timber and pulpwood), we estimate that the current area of carbon forests in Australia is 65 000 ha. Despite the national Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 and its 2010 amendments there are few extant biomass projects. How-ever this may change with the development of new technologies and the imposition of a carbon price on electricity production. The reasons for the gulf between actual and potential carbon AR activity are proposed to include (1) the absence of a formal carbon compliance scheme, (2) challenges in managing carbon through an entire product cycle, (3) the degree of understanding of carbon forestry by financiers, (4) landholder preference, (5) technical barriers and (6) regulatory uncertainty. We suggest an extension of the National Plantation Inventory from traditional plantations to carbon forestry, so that future policy can be developed on the basis of good-quality under-pinning information that can be disaggregated to analyse trends in AR for different purposes. To encourage innovation in the sector, we also suggest either the extension or establishment of research and development funding arrangements, similar to those already existing for other rural industries.",carbon sequestration; bioenergy; farm forestry,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6226288080215454,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Study of landowner behavior aids in designing more effective incentives for inducing land use and land cover changes to help mitigate climate change by reducing net greenhouse gas emissions. Afforestation, deforestation, reforestation, and timber harvest are the most frequent land management practices that influence forest carbon stocks and flux. Research studies provide estimates of how private landowners respond to market signals and government programs and how they alter land management. For example, landowners have tended to retain subsidized afforested stands well beyond program life in the United States, suggesting that similar programs for climate change mitigation could result in high rates of retention. At the same time, policy makers need to be aware that unintended consequences of policies can lead to significantly different outcomes than envisioned, including leakage possibilities.",mitigation; adaptation; carbon sequestration; forest sector,Review,2003.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6225182414054871,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

5196619,Economic optimization of a bioenergy-based hybrid renewable energy system under carbon policies—from the life-cycle perspective,"Rural areas are rich in renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar, and biomass. Bioenergy is a “zero-carbon energy”; therefore, bioenergy-based hybrid renewable energy systems (HRESs) are expected to be an important path for rural energy transformation. However, economic conditions make it difficult to mobilize investors in rural areas. Based on carbon emissions measured via life cycle assessment, an economic optimization mechanism was developed for HRESs under three carbon policies. The impacts of these three policies, carbon tax, carbon cap-and-trade, and carbon offset, on the economic and emission reduction benefits of HRESs were explored. The results showed that the introduction of biomass intermediate pyrolysis poly-generation could significantly reduce HRES emissions. Particularly, “carbon fixation” in biochar accounts for >60% of negative carbon emissions. By participating in the carbon mechanism, the economic benefits of the HRES in this study increased by $6776 compared with that of the integrated energy system in the urban area. This would effectively improve the dynamism of bioenergy-based HRESs. Considering the demands of different stages, the carbon policy implementation path “carbon offset – carbon cap-and-trade – carbon tax – carbon cap-and-trade” for HRESs was proposed. Based on a sensitivity analysis, the reference point of government carbon pricing can be obtained. The optimization mechanism may provide a reference for policymakers and investors, as well as help form a replicable and scalable HRES model in rural areas in the future. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,2022.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6198211312294006,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
808320,"2 °C target, India's climate action plan and urban transport sector","This paper examines climate impact of urban transport sources in India and its proposed mitigation plan to achieve 2 °C reduction goal in post-Kyoto era. In 2014, global economies agreed on adopting independent national determined contributions (INDCs) and action plans to reduce their carbon emissions. Subsequently, India released its INDCs in October 2015 with a commitment to reduce 33–35% of its CO 2 emission by the year 2030, compared to 2005 level. Adoption of green energy, afforestation and sustainable way of living were identified as key action points to achieve the underlined goal. However, this does not give clear guidelines for establishing sector specific targets and proposed interventions required for achieving post-Kyoto targets and measuring impacts in the near future. In case of transport sector, a strong emphasis was laid on mass-transit projects, energy efficient vehicles, bio-fuel and stringent vehicle emission norms to achieve desired results. Personal vehicles are identified and accepted as prominent contributor of air emissions; while, carbon emission and particulate matter from goods transport is equally responsible for deteriorating air quality in urban areas. Several regulatory and fiscal measure for reducing transport based carbon emission are documented; however, their adoption may affect communities and stakeholders in varied manner. Therefore, it becomes inevitable to conduct need assessment and stakeholder consultation to determine plausible challenges, prior to introducing a desired planning reforms. Further, the involved personnel in India should actively engage transport-based stakeholders during policy identification and its effective implementation to achieve desired results. © 2016 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies",,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6195952296257019,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The electric power sector has to make its own contributions to the national CO2 emissions mitigation target. In this study, a patron-client interactive optimized (PCIO) model is proposed to investigate the regional energy-water-carbon nexus optimization under the policy background of the CEUP target. Inner Mongolia, the largest energy base in China, which is also facing the prominent contradiction including the energy production and serious environmental problems, is chosen as a case study. Multiple uncertainties, including the fuel price uncertainty and output of the wind and solar power, are considered to make the optimization process more realistic. Results show that coal-fired power will gradually be substituted by the gas, wind, and solar power in Inner Mongolia to reach the CEUP target. The CO2 capture and storage technology and air-cooling systems will play important roles, especially under the strict water policy scenario. However, the achievement of the CEUP and water-saving target will be at the expense of high system costs.

2278049,The implications of ignoring smallholder agriculture in climate-financed forestry projects: empirical evidence from two REDD+ pilot projects,"Changes in agricultural practices can play a pivotal role in climate change mitigation by reducing the need for land use change as one of the biggest sources of GHG emissions, and by enabling carbon sequestration in farmers’ fields. Expansion of smallholder and commercial agriculture is often one of the main driving forces behind deforestation and forest degradation. However, mitigation programmes such as REDD+ are geared towards conservation efforts in the forestry sector without prominently taking into account smallholder agricultural interests in project design and implementation. REDD+ projects often build on existing re- and afforestation projects without major changes in their principles, interests and assumptions. Informed by case study research and interviews with national and international experts, we illustrate with examples from Ethiopia and Indonesia how REDD+ projects are implemented, how they fail to adequately incorporate the demands of smallholder farmers and how this leads to a loss of livelihoods and diminishing interest in participating in REDD+ by local farming communities. The study shows how the conservation-based benefits and insecure funding base in REDD+ projects do not compensate for the contraction in livelihoods from agriculture. Combined with exclusive benefit-sharing mechanisms, this results in an increased pressure on forest resources, diverging from the principal objective of REDD+. We note a gap between the REDD+ narratives at international level (i.e. coupling development with a climate agenda) and the livelihood interests of farming communities on the ground. We argue that without incorporating agricultural interests and a review of financial incentives in the design of future climate finance mechanisms, objectives of both livelihood improvements and GHG emission reductions will be missed. Key policy insights REDD+ is positioned as a promising tool to meet climate, conservation and development targets. However, these expectations are not being met in practice as the interests of smallholder farmers are poorly addressed. REDD+ policy developers and implementers need more focus on understanding the interests and dynamics of smallholder agriculturalists to enable inclusive, realistic and long-lasting projects. For REDD+ to succeed, funders need to consider how to better ensure long-term livelihood security for farming communities. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

480499,Evaluating the development of carbon capture and storage technologies in the United States,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is seen as an important solution to solve the twin challenge of reducing GHG emissions, while utilizing fossil fuel reserves to meet future energy requirements. In this study an innovation systems perspective is applied to review the development of CCS technologies in the US between 2000 and 2009 and to come up with policy recommendations for technology managers that wish to accelerate the deployment of CCS. The analysis describes the successful built-up of an innovation system around CCS and pinpoints the key determinants for this achievement. However, the evaluation of the system's performance also indicates that America's leading role in the development of CCS should not be taken for granted. It shows that the large CCS R&D networks, as well as the extensive CCS knowledge base, which have been accumulated over the past decade, have not yet been valorized by entrepreneurs to explore the market for integrated CCS concepts linked to power generation. Therefore, it is argued that the build-up of the innovation system has entered a critical phase that is decisive for a further thriving development of CCS technologies in the US. This study provides a clear understanding of the current barriers to the technology's future deployment and outlines a policy strategy that (1) stimulates technological learning; 2) facilitates collaboration and coordination in CCS actor networks; (3) creates financial and market incentives for the technology; and (4) provides supportive regulation and sound communication on CCS.

Tropical deforestation is emitting CO2 to the atmosphere, and a similar amount of CO2 is being removed from the atmosphere by the growth of forests elsewhere in the world, plus the acceleration of plant growth by increasing CO2 and N supply. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) considered it possible to increase afforestation to offset 7.5% of the carbon that is likely to be emitted by burning fossil fuels up to 2050. Individual countries are claiming forest carbon sinks to offset some of their requirement to cut fossil fuel emissions. Also, some companies are starting independent carbon offset projects.

In Europe, the age-old interaction between humans and ecosystems strongly influenced the cultural heritage. Yet European farmland is now being abandoned, especially in remote areas. The loss of the traditional agricultural landscapes and its consequences for biodiversity and ecosystem services is generating concerns in both the scientific community and the public. Here we ask to what extent farmland abandonment can be considered as an opportunity for rewilding ecosystems. We analyze the perceptions of traditional agriculture in Europe and their influence in land management policies. We argue that, contrary to the common perception, traditional agriculture practices were not environmentally friendly and that the standards of living of rural populations were low. We suggest that current policies to maintain extensive farming landscapes underestimate the human labor needed to sustain these landscapes and the recent and future dynamics of the socio-economic drivers behind abandonment. We examine the potential benefits for ecosystems and people from rewilding. We identify species that could benefit from land abandonment and forest regeneration and the ecosystem services that could be provided such as carbon sequestration and recreation. Finally, we discuss the challenges associated with rewilding, including the need to maintain open areas, the fire risks, and the conflicts between people and wildlife. Despite these challenges, we argue that rewilding should be recognized by policy-makers as one of the possible land management options in Europe, particularly on marginal areas.",farmland abandonment; land-use change; passive management; ecosystem services; land sharing; land sparing,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6168733835220337,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Different trajectories of BEE and energy supply technologies are compared in the urban context in a northern Chinese city. Vigorous improvement of BEE will significantly enhance the prospective financial capacity to facilitate deployment of backstop technologies (e.g. carbon capture and storage) in order to decarbonize the energy supply and achieve the long-term targets of low-carbon buildings. Carbon finance instruments should be used to facilitate public policy to accompany the necessary transition in the urban development process. The government-run efficiency procurement scheme will overcome the problem of insufficient incentive and high transaction costs associated with individual Clean Development Mechanism projects. Appropriate investment strategies (allocation of financial resources over the time frame) will allow local governments to harness the large potentials of carbon emissions mitigation while minimizing the risk of long-term technical lock-in in the built environment in Chinese cities.,China; climate change mitigation; energy efficiency; investment strategies; transition costs,text,2012.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6158968806266785,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Our analysis suggests that from the start of the project, the interactions between stakeholders were shaped by, and reinforced, a goal-rational meta-frame. This frame, and the respective interactions, did not function well in aligning project proponents and the local community. For the latter group, issues were at stake that could not be addressed within the goal-rational frame, such as moral considerations of procedural and distributive justice. Yet it was a very powerful frame that remained dominant and kept being reproduced throughout the process. Our analysis suggests that policy processes on projects like this should create interactions that leave open the opportunity for divergent, latent frames to become articulated. We identify three challenges for policy and planning of low-carbon technologies concerning the need for frame reflexivity in planning and decision making, the articulation of divergent stakeholder views and the design of stakeholder interactions.",frames; interactions; carbon capture and storage,Article,2015.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.6146243810653687,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
779430,Strategic responses to imposed innovation projects: The case of carbon capture and storage in the Alberta oil sands industry,"Today's 'activist' attitudes and strong power of non-market stakeholders (such as government agencies, non-governmental organizations, labor unions) have triggered the phenomenon of imposed innovation projects. These are investment projects carried out by profit-seeking firms primarily in response to the demands of influential non-market stakeholders. Such projects are supposedly instrumental to the emergence of new, socially beneficial products and production processes. We use a stakeholder management perspective to analyze the case study of a set of salient imposed innovation projects in the realm of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology, pursued in the 2011-2014 period by a number of energy companies in Western Canada. We describe the peculiarities of these projects and reveal the scope and drivers of firm-level actions in response to the pressure to pursue imposed innovations. The findings reveal a spectrum of strategic responses to imposed innovation pressures, with varying degrees of cooperation with other economic actors, and varying levels of engagement to tailor the imposed innovation to the firm's technological profile. We develop a set of propositions on the performance implications for firms implementing imposed innovation projects. The paper concludes with recommendations for policy makers concerned with the improved diffusion and effectiveness of such projects. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

858420,Matching policy and science: Rationale for the ‘4 per 1000 - soils for food security and climate’ initiative,"At the 21st session of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, COP21), a voluntary action plan, the ‘4 per 1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate’ was proposed under the Agenda for Action. The Initiative underlines the role of soil organic matter (SOM) in addressing the three-fold challenge of food and nutritional security, adaptation to climate change and mitigation of human-induced greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. It sets an ambitious aspirational target of a 4 per 1000 (i.e. 0.4%) rate of annual increase in global soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, with a focus on agricultural lands where farmers would ensure the carbon stewardship of soils, like they manage day-to-day multipurpose production systems in a changing environment. In this paper, the opportunities and challenges for the 4 per 1000 initiative are discussed. We show that the 4 per 1000 target, calculated relative to global top soil SOC stocks, is consistent with literature estimates of the technical potential for SOC sequestration, though the achievable potential is likely to be substantially lower given socio-economic constraints. We calculate that land-based negative emissions from additional SOC sequestration could significantly contribute to reducing the anthropogenic CO 2 equivalent emission gap identified from Nationally Determined Contributions pledged by countries to stabilize global warming levels below 2 °C or even 1.5 °C under the Paris agreement on climate. The 4 per 1000 target could be implemented by taking into account differentiated SOC stock baselines, reversing the current trend of huge soil CO 2 losses, e.g. from agriculture encroaching peatland soils. We further discuss the potential benefits of SOC stewardship for both degraded and healthy soils along contrasting spatial scales (field, farm, landscape and country) and temporal (year to century) horizons. Last, we present some of the implications relative to non-CO 2 GHGs emissions, water and nutrients use as well as co-benefits for crop yields and climate change adaptation. We underline the considerable challenges associated with the non-permanence of SOC stocks and show how the rates of adoption and the duration of improved soil management practices could alter the global impacts of practices under the 4 per 1000 initiative. We conclude that the 4 per 1000 initiative has potential to support multiple sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda. It can be regarded as no-regret since increasing SOC in agricultural soils will contribute to food security benefits that will enhance resilience to climate change. However, social, economic and environmental safeguards will be needed to ensure an equitable and sustainable implementation of the 4 per 1000 target. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Soil organic carbon; Agronomy; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economics; Environmental regulations; Food supply; Forestry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Organic carbon; Sustainable development; Adaptation to climate changes; Carbon sequestration; Climate change adaptation; Environmental safeguard; Soil management practices; Soil organic carbon; Stabilize global warming; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Soils; action plan; adaptive management; agricultural land; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; emission; food security; greenhouse gas; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil organic matter; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6139529943466187,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

According to the government's incentive model for carbon capture power plants, the regulation mechanism is developed when government controls carbon emission. When regional or national carbon emission quota is tense, significant effect can be obtained when regulators make regulations to take off low efficiency power plants. In addition, it is verified that the regulators should not blindly pursue a reduction in carbon emissions regardless of the cost. Therefore, regulators need to pay more attention to control the costs of carbon capture equipment and technology.

This paper tries to put into perspective the need for carbon capture and storage (CCS) in India's energy sector, specific to coal. It tries to make the argument that the policymakers must not solely depend on fairly new technologies like power generation via solar, without taking care of the existing coalfired power plants. Thus, putting forward the opportunities for CCS supported by necessary literature is undertaken as the principal task for this paper. The potential for CCS is discussed in terms of relevant capture and storage techniques in a technological and cost-based standpoint. Some of the considerations that can facilitate the deployment of CCS in various sectors pertaining to the industry are discussed. The paper also presents the need for discussing technologies such as direct air capture (DAC) in the Indian context. The review also presents a substantive view for CCS prospects in India, by reviewing its environmental and operational issues.

1048352,The Role of Decision-making in Ecosystem Service Trade-offs in Lowland Bolivia's Amazonian Agricultural Systems,"Tropical rainforests provide an array of increasingly threatened ecosystem services. Appropriation of these services can drive trade-offs, where the provision of one service may result in the diminution of another. Trade-offs are evident in regions of dynamic land-use change, like agricultural-forest systems, where conflicting goals of agricultural expansion and environmental conservation are present. The objectives of this study were to analyse ecosystem service relationships in the Province of Guarayos (Bolivia), explore the role of decision making in these relationships, and examine how policy scenarios might affect them. Application of multi-objective goal programming, maximising net farm income and net farm carbon sequestration across representative farms, outlined the presence of trade-offs. Farm carbon sequestration ranged from -2196 to 100% of goal values, whilst farm incomes ranged from 38 to 100% of its goal. Decision-making was explicitly behind these ranges, with extreme goal preferences driving the greatest trade-offs. Intermediate solutions, which may represent compromise management options to limit trade-offs, were identified. Application of policy scenarios only dampened, rather than eliminated trade-offs. These results reinforce the complex situation of contemporary decision-makers, balancing multiple, often conflicting goals. Development of models with greater input from decision-makers should be encouraged to assist in formulating viable management solutions and reduce tradeoffs.",Ecosystem services; Trade-offs; Decision-making; Agricultural income; Carbon sequestration; Multi-objective goal programming,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6118696331977844,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
78673,"TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE LAND MANAGEMENT IN THE DRYLANDS: SCIENTIFIC CONNECTIONS IN MONITORING AND ASSESSING DRYLAND DEGRADATION, CLIMATE CHANGE AND BIODIVERSITY","The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification and its sister conventions, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Convention on Biological Diversity, all aim to halt or mitigate the deterioration of the ecological processes on which life depends. Sustainable land management (SLM) is fundamental to achieving the goals of all three Conventions. Changes in land management undertaken to address dryland degradation and desertification can simultaneously reduce net greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to conservation of biodiversity. Management to protect and enhance terrestrial carbon stocks, both in vegetation and soil, is of central importance to all three conventions. Protection of biodiversity conveys stability and resilience to agro-ecosystems and increases carbon storage potential of dryland systems. SLM improves livelihoods of communities dependent on the land. Despite these complementarities between the three environmental goals, tradeoffs often arise in their pursuit. The importance of human-environment interactions to the condition of land compels attention to adaptive management. In order to reconcile concerns and agendas at a higher strategic level, identification of synergies, conflicts, trade-offs, interconnections, feedbacks and spillover effects among multiple objectives, drivers, actions, policies and time horizons are crucial. Once these issues are transparent, coordinated action can be put into place across the three multilateral environmental agreements in the development of strategies and policy measures to support SLM.

These initiatives include hydrogen roadmapping projects. Stakeholder involvement in strategic planning is of key importance to the successful implementation of the strategy. Thus, the views of the stakeholder group involved in the European roadmapping project HyWays are pertinent to the introduction of hydrogen in Europe. A qualitative assessment using the Key Changes and Actor Mapping (KCAM) methodology showed that on average stakeholders expect hydrogen systems to begin to be introduced over the next 15 years. Hydrogen production is expected to be based initially on steam methane reforming of natural gas and onsite electrolysis using wind power, and any hydrogen transport is likely to be by truck. The major challenges envisaged are to do with carbon capture and storage, high-temperature hydrogen production technologies and hydrogen pipeline development.

In practice, however, there are a number of factors which may disturb realization of the targets envisaged in these plans. Limitation to advancement of further energy conservation, not only in industrial sectors but also in other sectors where individual consumers play key roles, is certainly serious. Another crucial factor is the nuclear power. Recent accident at the experimental FBR, Monju, has influenced the public acceptance of nuclear power very seriously, and the government is now at the stage of re-designing the future scenario of nuclear power, taking into account both the opinions in favor of nuclear and those of anti-nuclear. Nevertheless most of energy experts believe that nuclear power is safe and also economical enough to be maintained for the intermediate future at least in Japan so that strong policy measures are to be introduced to improve public acceptance of nuclear power. The second pan of this paper describes the future of so called ''new energy'' which the government of Japan is eager to develop and also the limits to development of these ''new energy''. The third pat is contributed to description of R&D of long term technological options and also difficulties in realizing these options. It is also worth noting that Japan, both government and industries, has much interest in CO2 removal from flue gas of power plants and its disposal.

This study aims to illustrate how stakeholders and policymakers can take advantage of a web-based spatial decision support system (SDSS), namely SmartScape (TM) to either test existing crop change policies or produce effective crop change decisions using tradeoff analysis. We addressed the consequences of two common crop change scenarios for Dane county in Wisconsin, United States, (a) replacing perennial energy crops with annual energy crops and (b) replacing annual energy crops with perennial energy crops. The results suggested that converting areas under grass and alfalfa production that were located on high quality soil and flat slope to corn promoted a net-income and availability of gross biofuel. Additionally, the model outcome proposed that converting areas under corn and soy production that were located on high slope to grass promoted net-energy, phosphorus loading, soil loss, soil carbon sequestration, nitrous oxide emission, grassland bird habitat, pollinator abundance, and biocontrol. Therefore, SmartScape (TM) can assist strategic crop change policy by comparing the tradeoff among ecosystem services to ensure that crop change policies have outcomes that are agreeable to a diversity of policymakers.

619858,"Trees, people, the missing sink and the greenhouse effect","Land use activities constitute a major but uncertain source of emissions currently enhancing the greenhouse effect. The terrestrial stock of carbon is also uncertain and has been hypothesised as a possible site for the ""missing' carbon sink. The policy implications of the missing sink being located in the terrestrial biota are discussed. Future strategies which offset global emissions through afforestation, for example, may become more cost effective with increased CO2 fertilisation or through the re-estimation of biomass and soil carbon uptake. Estimates are presented of the cost-effectiveness of afforesting land diverted from agriculture in the UK in this context. It is found that the likelihood both of afforestation, and of halting deforestation globally, is diminished by policy failures which exacerbate unsustainable and undesirable use of land. A greater understanding of the location of the missing sink could redirect abatement efforts towards the conservation of land based resources, and make the carbon cycle implications of land use change an even more significant issue. -from Authors",,Article,1994.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6095536947250366,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
494222,Ethical attitudes to underground CO2 storage: Points of convergence and potential faultlines,"While awareness is growing that ethical and justice-based debates hold implications for the development of fair and effective climate policy, the specific ethical implications of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) deployment have received limited attention. Here, we present a preliminary assessment of ethical attitudes to CCS. The aim was to develop a methodology which can support a clear scoping out of potential issues and to lay the foundations from which to develop a fully deliberative approach. This article draws largely upon the empirical analysis and results with some reference to the method. An ethical matrix approach is used to provide a summary of a so-called ethical landscape, primarily from a European perspective, in which perspectives of CCS are mapped out as they relate to certain ethical principles. Opinions represented on the matrix begin to coalesce around compliance with the principle of providing benefits (a pre-requisite of pursuing development) while potential faultlines were observed for the following principles: environmental justice, preventing harm, scientific/technical competence, managerial/regulatory competence. Accountability (in the context of long term storage) was revealed to present a key challenge, exposing the current immaturity of legal and regulatory frameworks. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Using detailed forest inventory data, we projected carbon sequestration outcomes in the coterminous 48 states for a baseline scenario and three policy scenarios through 2050. Alternatives included (1) reducing deforestation from development, (2) afforestation in the eastern United States and reforestation in the western United States, and (3) reducing stand-replacing wildfires.

716720,Policy options in a worst case climate change world,"Climatic changes more rapid and extreme than assessed by the IPCC cannot be excluded, because of the possibility of positive earth system feedbacks and thresholds. Do today's policy makers have to take these into account, and if so, are the options different from those considered today? The paper briefly summarizes the types of extreme climatic changes noted in the literature and then evaluates the options to address them in a what-if manner. Different from other studies, which usually look at only one type of measure, we consider a broader portfolio of options: drastic emissions reduction programmes, drawing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere (""carbon dioxide removal""), ""emergency cooling"" through influencing the radiative balance of the atmosphere (""solar radiation management""), and finally adaptation beyond the options considered seriously today. Politics will have to decide on the choice or mix of ""emergency"" measures, but research can ensure that such decisions are based on the best scientific information. If through concerted international efforts to mitigate greenhouse emissions low stabilization levels could be reached, such decisions may never have to be made. However, research in support of some form of a ""plan B"" is now warranted, focusing on those options that have the most positive ratio between potential effectiveness and feasibility on the one hand, and environmental and political risks on the other hand. Such plan should not be limited to one set of options such as geo-engineering and should explicitly take into account not only the relationships between the options but also the wide variety in characteristics of the individual options in terms of effectiveness, feasibility, environmental risks, and political implications.",Climate policy; Geoengineering; Governance; Extreme climate change; Mitigation,Article,2010.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6081904768943787,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
799229,Motivations and barriers for Western Australian broad-acre farmers to adopt carbon farming,"Carbon farming policies aim to contribute to climate change mitigation, but their success strongly depends on whether landholders actually adopt desired practices or participate in offered programs. The Australian Government's Carbon Fanning Initiative and Emissions Reduction Fund policies were designed to incentivise the adoption of carbon farming practices. Although these policies have been active since December 2011, farmer engagement has been limited, and net emissions reductions low as a result. We surveyed broad-acre farmers in the Western Australian wheatbelt to explore their drivers and barriers to adopting carbon farming practices and participating in carbon fanning policy programs. Drivers of adoption included knowledge and perception of co-benefits (for yield, productivity, and the environment), knowing another adopter, and believing that changes to farm management are an appropriate method to reduce Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. Barriers to adoption included lack of information, uncertainty and costs. The key barrier to participation was policy and political uncertainty. The determinants of adoption and participation that we identify in our study offer important insights into how to best ensure the success of Australia's land sector-based climate change policies. We conclude that, to increase landholder engagement, the co-benefits and climate change benefits of carbon farming practices must be actively promoted, and additional information is needed about the costs associated with adoption. Information diffusion is best achieved if it actively leverages landholder social networks. Finally, our results indicate that landholder buy-in to carbon farming could be greatly enhanced by achieving more continuity in Australian climate change policies and politics.",Climate change mitigation; Carbon farming; Emissions reduction policies; Land management; Policy adoption,Article,2017.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.6078087687492371,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Community engagements under village administration should be the main strategy for supporting peatlands restoration. Since the new law on villages was enacted in 2014, the village has gained authority and delegated responsibilities from the upper-level government to make rural development decisions in various sectors, including those connected to environmental management, such as peatland restoration. The recognition of authority is followed by the transfer of significant funds, called village funds, from the central government as a form of commitment to undertake the village law. Currently, applied regulations allow community engagement to utilize the village fund for supporting peatland restoration. This study investigated the community's perceptions of village fund utilization for peatland restoration through in-depth interviews and questionnaires with site-level stakeholders that influence village budget allocation-related policies. The investigated aspects included village budgeting and development planning mechanism, the capacity of the community, and rules of district government in supervising the villages. Based on our findings, the identified challenges include the absence of environmental aspects as a part of village development pillars for developing village planning and budgeting, lack of community's environmental-economical nexus knowledge, and lack of district government in supervising village fund utilization and management at the site-level. However, the opportunities to direct the village fund utilization for peatlands restoration are widely open by strengthening the roles of district government to improve village fund governance at the site level.",Peatland; Restoration; Village; Village fund; Community engagement,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.6067726612091064,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The United Kingdom and Germany have initiated research programs on climate intervention technologies. Some senior managers at federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DOE), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration would like to initiate research funding, but they cannot act without political cover, given the understandably controversial nature of the technology. Scientists have identified a range of engineering options, collectively called geoengineering, to address the control of greenhouse gases and reduce the risks of climate change. One class of geoengineering strategies is carbon dioxide removal (CDR), which removes greenhouse gases from the atmosphere after they have already been released.

193370,A Path Forward for Low Carbon Power from Biomass,"The two major pathways for energy utilization from biomass are conversion to a liquid fuel (i.e., biofuels) or conversion to electricity (i.e., biopower). In the United States (US), biomass policy has focused on biofuels. However, this paper will investigate three options for biopower: low co-firing (co-firing scenarios refer to combusting a given percentage of biomass with coal) (5%-10% biomass), medium co-firing (15%-20% biomass), and dedicated biomass firing (100% biomass). We analyze the economic and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions impact of each of these options, with and without CO2 capture and storage (CCS). Our analysis shows that in the absence of land use change emissions, all biomass co-combustion scenarios result in a decrease in GHG emissions over coal generation alone. The two biggest barriers to biopower are concerns about carbon neutrality of biomass fuels and the high cost compared to today's electricity prices. This paper recommends two policy actions. First, the need to define sustainability criteria and initiate a certification process so that biomass providers have a fixed set of guidelines to determine whether their feedstocks qualify as renewable energy sources. Second, the need for a consistent, predictable policy that provides the economic incentives to make biopower economically attractive.",,Article,2015.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.6050407886505127,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Here, the method is described with reference to the construction and analysis of a map of the ethical landscape of carbon capture and storage technology.

Because of the expected scale of these systems and the properties of the CO2 being transported, CCS pipeline systems may require different approaches for risk assessment and regulation compared to other, more common gasses, such as natural gas. There is also a general lack of knowledge amongst stakeholders around the safety issues of CCS, which must be addressed to achieve acceptance. This paper outlines the results of a study undertaken by Environmental Resources Management (ERM) for the CO2 Capture Project (CCP) to better understand these considerations.

5346802,CLIMATE-SMART AGRICULTURE CERTIFICATION: A CALL FOR FEDERAL ACTION,"Agriculture systems are extremely susceptible to the consequences of climate change. Extreme weather events, changing temperature patterns, and invasive pests and weeds threaten our nation’s crop yields and food security. U.S. agriculture is also a leading contributor to climate change, as industrial farming and land management practices emit around a third of nationwide greenhouse gases. Certain climate-friendly agriculture practices have the potential to combat climate change by sequestering carbon and reducing emissions. Despite this opportunity, current federal farming policies, heavily influenced by “big-ag” lobbyists and consoli-dated farming industries, do not incentivize such “climate-smart” agriculture practices. This Comment proposes a federal climate-smart certification pro-gram for producers who use such practices. In comparison to USDA organic certification, where the government responded to fears about pesticide and synthetic fertilizer use by creating a trustworthy indicator for organic producers, it asks Congress to now take action to identify those producers who practice climate-smart agriculture and to catalyze a widespread transition through Farm Bill policy. It argues that certification would standardize climate-smart agriculture throughout the United States by establishing minimum best practices, assuring consumers of the truthfulness of producers’ environmental claims, and incentivizing farm-ers through government subsidies and benefits. A USDA-enforced seal could create a lucrative and environmentally sustainable market for climate-smart commodities. With government support, consumer buy-in, and broad farmer adoption, U.S. agriculture could in fact combat climate change, rather than exacerbate it. © 2022, Columbia Law Review Association.

Then, the expected influence of this policy on decisions about which type of forest to use for afforestation and reforestation is discussed. An. optimal control model is used to analyze the choice between two types of forests: (i) one with high timber and carbon sequestration values but lower, or negative, biodiversity values; and (ii) one with lower timber and carbon sequestration benefits, but with high biodiversity values. Finally, the relationship between the Kyoto process and the Convention on Biological Diversity is investigated, to assess whether or not the latter is expected to have any influence on the outcomes obtained in the analysis above.

The net zero GHG emissions would be achieved through complete decarbonisation of industrial and energy systems along with Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) and greenhouse gas removal technology. This paper discussed the decarbonisation targets of UK and Germany and several strategies for the short term and long term implementation undertaken by the government. The main objective of the paper was to describe the potential role of hydrogen as an energy vector especially focusing on the hydrogen roadmap in the EU. A theoretical assessment has been done including case studies of research and development projects and policies which are being executed in UK and Germany to understand the opportunities and challenges of hydrogen energy system. However, there are challenges to attain this hydrogen based low carbon economy. This paper stated hydrogen as the potential paradigm shifter [2].

5342720,Climate pledges versus commitment: Are policy actions of Middle-East and North African countries consistent with their emissions targets?,"Carbon emission is inevitable, and changes with energy consumption and economic development, presents policy options toward sustainable development path. Currently, there is little assurance from policymakers in committing to climate change pledges: taking the Middle-East and North African (MENA) region as a specific case with using 2019 as a cut-off period. We conducted an interim assessment of the Paris Agreement to ascertain whether climate actions are in tandem with emissions reduction targets. Making use of difference-in-difference technique as a quasi-experiment supported by fixed-effects and placebo treatment models, the results point to evidence of less than 1% effective CO2 emissions reduction as of 2019 compared to the 2015 level. The current carbon emissions reduction commitment level is far-reaching contrary to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) pledged (16.43% on average by 2030 compared to the 2015 level). The analysis suggests that achieving NDCs commitments are currently major burden on policymakers since the economic development is highly linked with nonrenewable energy consumption. Furthermore, a more comprehensive framework when accounting for all available renewable and clean energy projects shows reduction levels in the range of 30%–40% from 2020 to 2030. These results suggest that the Paris Agreement in MENA countries may be more effective from 2020, thus underscore the importance of capturing ongoing projects (involving renewable and clean energy technologies) into interim policy assessment. The shared implication is that greater efforts are demanded from the region and at country levels to further decrease emissions through the use of negative emissions technologies particularly in the electricity generation sector. © 2022 The Authors",,Article,2022.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5991693139076233,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

685950,Terrestrial ecosystem management for climate change mitigation,"Decreasing the human impact on the atmosphere will necessitate active management of terrestrial carbon pools and greenhouse gas fluxes. Biospheric greenhouse gas emission mitigation measures such as increasing forest area and increasing forest biomass density, build-up of soil carbon and avoided emissions from deforestation offer cost-efficient solutions while in the long run they are limited by land availability, saturation, and concerns about their permanence. Biomass can also be used to produce low greenhouse gas intensive materials, feedstock for energy production and if combined with carbon capture and sequestration it can offer permanent negative emissions. Although most terrestrial management options appear as competitive mitigation measures from an economic point of view, issues of governance remain most contentious as they induce competition for land and other ecosystem services.",,Review,2010.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5987825989723206,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
677330,Drivers of peak warming in a consumption-maximizing world,"Peak human-induced warming is primarily determined by cumulative CO2 emissions up to the time they are reduced to zero(1-3). In an idealized economically optimal scenario(4,5), warming continues until the social cost of carbon, which increases with both temperature and consumption because of greater willingness to pay for climate change avoidance in a prosperous world, exceeds the marginal cost of abatement at zero emissions, which is the cost of preventing, or recapturing, the last net tonne of CO2 emissions. Here I show that, under these conditions, peak warming is primarily determined by two quantities that are directly affected by near-term policy: the cost of 'backstop' mitigation measures available as temperatures approach their peak (those whose cost per tonne abated does not increase as emissions fall to zero); and the average carbon intensity of growth (the ratio between average emissions and the average rate of economic growth) between now and the time of peak warming. Backstop costs are particularly important at low peak warming levels. This highlights the importance of maintaining economic growth in a carbon-constrained world and reducing the cost of backstop measures, such as large-scale CO2 removal, in any ambitious consumption-maximizing strategy to limit peak warming.",,Article,2016.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5987628102302551,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
898956,Comparing future patterns of energy system change in 2 degrees C scenarios to expert projections,"Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are computer-based instruments used to assess the implications of human activity on the human and earth system. They are simultaneously also used to explore possible response strategies to climate change. As IAMs operate simplified representations of real-world processes within their model structures, they have been frequently criticised to insufficiently represent the opportunities and challenges in future energy systems over time. To test whether projections by IAMB diverge in systematic ways from projections made by technology experts we elicited expert opinion on prospective change for two indicators and compared these with the outcomes of IAM studies. We specifically focused on five (energy) technology families (solar, wind, biomass, nuclear, and carbon capture and storage or CCS) and compared the considered implications of the presence or absence of climate policy on the growth and diffusion of these technologies over the short (2030) to medium (2050) term. IAMs and experts were found to be in relatively high agreement on system change in a business-as-usual scenario, albeit with significant differences in the estimated magnitude of technology deployment over time. Under stringent climate policy assumptions, such as the internationally agreed upon objective to limit global mean temperature increase to no more than 2 degrees C, we found that the differences in estimated magnitudes became smaller for some technologies and larger for others.

We estimate the reductions in agricultural externalities (soil erosion, nitrogen, and atrazine pollution) from an afforestation program in Wisconsin. Existing benefits estimates are used to quantify the value of reduced soil erosion and some benefits from enhanced wildlife habitat. These values are the same order of magnitude as the costs of the carbon sequestration policy, indicating that the co-benefits of forest carbon sinks are an important factor for countries to consider in designing a portfolio of climate mitigation strategies.",,Article,2003.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5972399115562439,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1793850,Financing Carbon Capture and Storage Projects the Results of Two Expert Meetings,"The IEA 2007 World Energy Outlook forecasts that fossil fuel will continue to dominate the energy mix until 2030, including large economies such as the EU, Japan, US and China. A growing concern among many countries is the design of mechanisms that will finance clean coal technologies and in particular carbon capture and storage projects. To illustrate, it is estimated that the United States will require 170 GW of new coal-fired capacity prior to 2030 with 90% of that being post 2015. Therefore substantial government and private investment into carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects will be required and mechanisms designed to facilitate that investment. Many organizations are examining this issue including the IEA Clean Coal Centre, IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme, Clean Coal Power Initiative and the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF). In 2007 and 2008 two expert meetings on financing post-demonstration CCS projects were organised in London and New York by the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme and the IEA Clean Coal Centre, with the support of the World Coal Institute and sponsorship from Chevron and Rio Tinto. This paper reports back the results of those meetings in regard to identifying the key drivers for financing post-demonstration CCS projects in Europe and North America. This is of particular interest with the restructuring of the USA FutureGen Programme as well as the proposed inclusion of CCS within the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU-ETS) in the future. Different options for financing such projects are explored and compared with a focus on how they could assist in the realisation of commercial CCS projects. In additions, this paper examines the response by the insurance, banking and other financial sectors to the potential investment opportunities CCS projects could provide in dealing with issues such as liability and project investment. Lastly, the paper analyses the knowledge and awareness of CCS technology within the financial community in general. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

90094,The influence of negative emission technologies and technology policies on the optimal climate mitigation portfolio,"Combining policies to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere with policies to reduce emissions could decrease CO2 concentrations faster than possible via natural processes. We model the optimal selection of a dynamic portfolio of abatement, research and development (R&D), and negative emission policies under an exogenous CO2 constraint and with stochastic technological change. We find that near-term abatement is not sensitive to the availability of R&D policies, but the anticipated availability of negative emission strategies can reduce the near-term abatement optimally undertaken to meet 2A degrees C temperature limits. Further, planning to deploy negative emission technologies shifts optimal R&D funding from ""carbon-free"" technologies into ""emission intensity"" technologies. Making negative emission strategies available enables an 80% reduction in the cost of keeping year 2100 CO2 concentrations near their current level. However, negative emission strategies are less important if the possibility of tipping points rules out using late-century net negative emissions to temporarily overshoot the CO2 constraint earlier in the century.",,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5967317819595337,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

Acceptability of domestic vs. international reforestation programmes in the lab,"Following the entry into force of the Paris Agreement in November 2016, governments around the world are now expected to turn their nationally determined contributions into concrete climate policies. Given the global public good nature of climate change mitigation and the important cross-country differences in marginal abatement costs, distributing mitigation efforts across countries could substantially lower the overall cost of implementing climate policy. However, abating emissions abroad instead of domestically may face important political and popular resistance. We ran a lab experiment with more than 300 participants and asked them to choose between a domestic and an international reforestation project. We tested the effect of three informational treatments on the allocation of participants' endowment between the domestic and the international project. The treatments consisted in: (1) making more salient the cost-effectiveness gains associated with offsetting carbon abroad; (2) providing guarantees on the reliability of reforestation programmes; (3) stressing local ancillary benefits associated with domestic offset projects. We found that stressing the cost-effectiveness of the reforestation programme abroad did increase its support, the economic argument in favour of offsetting abroad being otherwise overlooked by participants. We relate this finding to the recent literature on the drivers of public support for climate policies, generally pointing to a gap between people's preferences and economists' prescriptions.

Since the time scales of the global carbon cycle are largely driven by the exchanges with the natural oceanic stocks, the implementation of CDR actions is anticipated to create outgassing from the ocean that may reduce their efficiency. The adjustment of the natural carbon cycle to CDR was studied with a numerical Earth System Model, focusing on the oceanic component and considering two idealized families of CDR policies, one based on a target atmospheric concentration and one based on planned negative emissions. Results show that both actions are anticipated to release the anthropogenic carbon stored in the surface ocean, effectively increasing the required removal effort. The additional negative emissions are expected to be lower when the CDR policy is driven by planned removal rates without prescribing a target atmospheric CO2 concentration.",,Article,2013.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5959402322769165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The potential has not been realised in sub-Saharan Africa, which is most vulnerable in terms of food security in a changing climate. The objective of this study was to create an analytical framework to identify determining factors to enhance food security through mitigation of climate change. The potential for carbon trading between Finland and Ethiopia was the studied case. A hypothetical analytical framework was created based on literature. It was validated and developed through in-depth interviews and focus group discussions of global and national actors in Finland and Ethiopia and local actors from two contrasting Ethiopian regions. The qualitative analysis highlighted increasing agricultural productivity and facilitating internal national markets as the main means to enhance food security through mitigation of climate change, triggered by generating carbon income. The socio-economic determinants of major importance appeared to be multi-level coherence of policy and action, early access to financial incentives, quality of governance, infrastructure for internal markets, population density, land tenure systems and knowledge about carbon markets, mitigation options and their verification. The main agro-ecological determinants were local hydrology, management history and present land management. The immediate attention of decision-makers is drawn to policy coherence and development of funding, verification and knowledge on carbon sequestration through agricultural management. The analytical framework is concluded to be valid for interaction between industrial countries and specific national and local SSA contexts. © 2012, Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI).",,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5957739353179932,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
9109,"Virtual nature, violent accumulation: The 'spectacular failure' of carbon offsetting at a Ugandan National Park","In East Africa, financially strained governments increasingly experiment with voluntary, market-based carbon offset schemes for enhancing the public management of protected areas. Often, conservationists and governments portray these as 'triple-win' solutions for climate change mitigation, biodiversity preservation, and local socioeconomic development. Examining such rhetoric, this paper analyses the rise and decline of an integrated carbon offset and conservation initiative at Mount Elgon National Park in eastern Uganda, involving a partnership between the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) and a Dutch NGO, Face the Future. In doing so, the paper reveals the ways in which the uncompensated dispossession of local residents was a necessary precondition for the project's implementation. Although external auditors expected the project to sequester 3.73 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO(2)e) between 1994 and 2034, conflicts forced the scheme to cease reforestation in 2003. Noting this rapid decline, we problematize the ways in which Face the Future and other carbon market intermediaries represented their activities via project documents and websites, obscuring the violence that was necessary for the project's implementation. In so doing, we argue that the maintenance of a 'triple win' spectacle is itself integral to the management of carbon sequestration projects, as it provides consumers with a form of 'ethical' use value, and greatly enhances the capacity of carbon market brokers to accumulate exchange value by attracting 'green' investors. Consequently, what we term a 'spectacular failure' manifests in at least two ways: first, in the unravelling of the heavily mediatized spectacle of harmonious, profitable conservation, and, second, in the deleterious nature of the consequences that accrue to local communities and ecosystems alike.

Oceania's rich terrestrial biodiversity is facing unprecedented threats through the interaction of pervasive environmental threats (deforestation and degradation; introduced and invasive species; fragmentation) and the effects of anthropogenic climate change (sea level rise; altered rainfall patterns and increased fire frequency; temperature rises and increased storm severity, extreme weather events and abrupt system changes). All nine of Oceania's terrestrial biomes harbour ecosystems and habitat types that are highly vulnerable under climate change, posing an immense conservation challenge. Current policies and management practices are inadequate and the need for new legislation and economic mechanisms is clear, despite powerful interests committed to limiting progress. Mitigation can be achieved by increasing the effectiveness of the protected area network, by maintaining and effectively managing existing carbon stocks and biodiversity, and by reforestation to sequester atmospheric carbon. A price on carbon emissions may encourage less carbon-intensive energy use while simultaneously encouraging reforestation on long-cleared land, and reducing degradation of native forests.

Through a qualitative analysis of fossil fuel company and trade organization framings of CCS, three frames are identified: (1) faith in innovation, or, the belief that any barrier that fetters technological solutions to environmental problems can be overcome; (2) value instrumentalization, or, the predominance of instrumental values when justifying or explaining the benefits of technological solutions; and (3) status quo maintenance, or, the application or anticipated application of technological solutions in order to reproduce the most fundamental processes and social structures that characterize modern societies. Frames tend to omit the following issues and concerns relevant to CCS: (4) potential social and environmental risks (risk minimization); (5) non-instrumental values (value restriction); and (6) possible future scenarios that are qualitatively different than a growing economy powered by increased energy throughput (possibility blindness).

1696519,What lessons can hydraulic fracturing teach CCS about social acceptance?,"As with many technologies, carbon capture and storage (CCS) faces social acceptance challenges that can impact the pace of its development and deployment. Previous studies on the social acceptance of CCS have tended to rely on case studies of pilot projects or surveys of decision makers and the general public. Here, we take a different approach, using real world data about the social acceptance of hydraulic fracturing technologies to glean lessons for future carbon storage efforts. Hydraulic fracturing has many of the same operations, risks, and social narratives as carbon storage, making it a valid comparison. We conduct a statistical analysis on the relationship between various state demographic and economic factors and the stringency of state regulations governing the hydraulic fracturing industry. As a complement to this analysis, we conduct a comparative case study on the development of hydraulic fracturing regulations in New York and Pennsylvania. We find robust statistical evidence that familiarity with the oil and gas industry is associated with a decrease in regulatory variance among states where hydraulic fracturing takes place. Moreover, we identify a tension between regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing at the state level and regulatory control at the local level. This dynamic suggests that carbon storage policymakers and industrial leaders should emphasize local engagement in addition to state-level participation. (C) 2014 The Authors.

898363,"Marginal abatement cost curves for agricultural climate policy: State-of-the art, lessons learnt and future potential","Combatting climate change has risen to the top of the international policy discourse. Effective governance necessitates the generation of concise information on the costs-effectiveness of policy instruments aimed at reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) approach is a framework commonly used to summarise information of potential mitigation effort, and can help in identifying the most cost-effective managerial and technological GHG mitigation options. Agriculture offers key opportunities to mitigate GHG emissions and utilise carbon (C) sink potentials. Therefore, a number of countries have developed national agricultural MACCs in the last decade. Whilst these MACCs have undoubtedly been catalysers for the information exchange between science and policy, they have also accentuated a range of constraints and limitations. In response, each of the scientific teams developed solutions in an attempt to address one or more of these limitations. These solutions represent 'lessons learned' which are invaluable for the development of future MACCs. To consolidate and harness this knowledge that has heretofore been dispersed across countries, this paper reviews the engineering agricultural MACCs developed in European countries. We collate the state-of-the-art, review the lessons learnt, and provide a more coherent framework for countries or research groups embarking on a trajectory to develop an agricultural MACC that assesses mitigations both within the farm gate and to the wider bioeconomy. We highlight the contemporary methodological developments, specifically on 1) the emergence of stratified MACCs; 2) accounting for soil carbon sequestration 3) accounting for upstream and downstream emissions; 4) the development of comprehensive cost-calculations; 5) accounting for environmental co-effects and 6) uncertainty analyses. We subsequently discuss how the mitigation potential summarised by MACCs can be incentivised in practice and how this mitigation can be captured in national inventories. We conclude that the main purpose of engineering MACCs is not necessarily the accurate prediction of the total abatement potential and associated costs, but rather the provision of a coherent forum for the complex discussions surrounding agricultural GHG mitigation, and to visualise opportunities and low. hanging fruit in a single graphic and manuscript.

Two case studies, each at a different scale, are presented. First, the N'hambita Community Carbon Project in Mozambique, a REDD+ project, promoted agro-forestry and reforestation activities along with alternative livelihoods. Second, the Sloping Lands Conversion Programme (SLCP) in China is a national-level reforestation scheme to supply watershed services. Impacts on the poor are addressed through the 'lens' of a rural household allocating its labour supply to different income sources. Four aspects of REDD+ policy are discussed: the incentives necessary for ensuring the cost-effective, long-run sustainability of both carbon sinks and incomes; the implications for forest conservation, in particular biodiversity; the need for scaling up carbon sequestration activities in order to minimise carbon leakage; and, the possibilities to maximise the participation of the poor and alleviate poverty. Finally, the paper highlights the importance of using appropriate methodologies for correct evaluation of policy impacts on incomes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

656519,IMPACTS OF EMISSION TRADING MARKETS ON COMPETITIVENESS OF FORESTRY BIOMASS IN CROATIA,"A rising share of renewable energy sources in the overall energy balance is one of the strategic goals of a growing number of countries. By signing international agreements (e.g. the Kyoto Protocol), and in accordance with the legislature and accession to the EU, Croatia undertook the obligation to make concrete steps and increase the use of renewable energy sources, as stated by the paradigm ""sustainable development"". In Croatia, biomass is a renewable energy source with the greatest potential. The goal of this work is to explore the impact of the European Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS Scheme) and flexible mechanisms of the Kyoto Protocol - the Joint Implementation Mechanism, JI, and the Clean Development Mechanism, CDM, - on the competitiveness of biomass energy production. Compared to fossil fuels, the advantage of biomass is that energy from biomass combustion is considered CO2 free technology, since biomass sequesters CO2 as part of photosynthesis. The EU ETS restricts emission amounts at the national level and at the level of single installation. Every industrial operator is allocated a certain amount of emission allowances. In order to satisfy their needs, the operators may trade with their allowances and purchase emission allowances oil the market. The JI and CDM projects represent flexible Kyoto mechanisms which allow investment in emissions reduction outside the investing country. The amount of emissions reduced in such projects is used to satisfy the allowances of the investing countries, while the price of CO2 emissions per ton is determined by the market. An allocated amount of emissions which an installation or a country may emit increases the competitiveness of low-carbon technologies. Forest management and exploatation produces large quantities of forest biomass, which can be used for energy production. Biomass can additionally be generated by the establishment of bioenergy plantations and biomass production in short rotation crops (SRC) of forest tree species. The article presents a mathematical economic model which explores the impact of CO2 prices on investment decisions related to the construction of new electrical power plants or a change of fuels in the existing plants. The model determines emissions allowance prices at which biomass becomes more competitive than other technologies. Changes in CO2 prices affect short run marginal costs (SRMC) and long run marginal costs (LRMC) of electrical energy production, where a decision on the replacement of fuel in the existing plant depends on trends in short run marginal costs, whereas an investment decision to construct new electrical plants depends on long run marginal costs. According to the results of the applied model, biomass fuel in the existing plants (comparison of SRMC) is more competitive than gas even with minimal biomass prices and no additional CO2 allowance price or feed-in tariffs. With CO2 prices larger than 26 (sic)/t CO2, biomass becomes more competitive than gas and coal for its minimal price, while for its maximal price it is more competitive at CO2 prices larger than 21 (sic)/t CO2.",forest biomass; EU ETS scheme; short run (SRMC) and long run marginal costs (LRMC); Croatia,Article,2009.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5890129208564758,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

This paper challenges the argument often put forward that, due to the greater distances from centres of population, it will be 'easier' to garner public and stakeholder support for offshore CO2 storage than onshore. Based on the results of research interviews carried out with stakeholders and informed publics in Scotland, challenges for public and stakeholder acceptance of sub-seabed CO2 storage that may require further policy attention are identified. Whilst existing policy for sub-seabed CO2 storage is cognisant of the need for societal engagement, it may be the case that these regulations may need further reinforcement to ensure future developments are able to address social acceptability issues as fully as possible. The value of taking into account social as well as physical characteristics at the site selection phase, the need for mechanisms to take seriously stakeholder conceptions of uncertainty, and the importance of extending social engagement beyond risk communication are discussed.

This paper illuminates how stakeholder issues could be strategically managed in the deployment of CCS, in a manner customized to such developing countries. Based on the input from 28 stakeholders of various interests and nationalities (i.e., from China, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Indonesia), this study applies Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and MICMAC analysis, in order to develop a management model to address stakeholder issues regarding the deployment of CCS. Our findings revealed eight legislative issues, four social issues, three economic issues, five technological issues, and five environmental management issues. The model revealed that legislative issues, such as those relating to CO2 definition, licensing, land acquisition framework, and expertise, should be managed prior to other issues, that is, in the early stage of CCS deployment. Addressing environmental issues related to promoting public awareness and perception of CCS benefits are among the key drivers in deploying CCS.

Here we review the actions undertaken by both the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), aimed to stabilize and reduce concentrations of greenhouse gases (GHG) in atmosphere, including the Kyoto Protocol that obliges developed countries to provide the political and legal framework to meet the Protocol's expectations. Moreover, it is mandatory for national policies to reduce the occurrence of main risky events, such as landslides, floods, and desertification processes, whose frequency have rapidly risen in the Mediterranean regions mostly susceptible to climatic changes. According to the Kyoto Protocol, each signed party should include, in its annual GHG inventory, information on GHG possibly removed by means of carbon sinks activities such as land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). Italian laws encompass the National System for the Italian Greenhouse Gas Inventory and the National Registry for Carbon sinks. The latter estimates GHG emissions by sources and accounts for their net removal based on sinks of the LULUCF sector that includes forest land, cropland, grassland, wetlands, and settlements. These compartments in 2008 removed 87.3 Mt of CO<inf>2</inf> from atmosphere while, from 1990 to 2008, the total removal as CO<inf>2</inf> equivalent increased by 34.8%, CO<inf>2</inf> accounting for more than 99% of both total emissions and removals of the sector. Within this frame, carbon sequestration in cultivated soils has become important to add new carbon sinks other than LULUCF. The relation of soil management practices to the increase in soil organic matter is a basic requirement to develop a solid methodology to assess carbon stock changes in soil pool and provide a useful database over the national territory. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

424527,Managing afforestation and reforestation for carbon sequestration: Considerations for land managers and policy makers,"Forest management of planted and natural secondary forests for carbon sequestration, applied in the appropriate contexts, presents many opportunities for climate change mitigation and adaptation. In climate change policy discussions, planted and natural secondary forests are placed in the category of afforestation and reforestation (A/R) projects. Temperate regions currently contain most of the existing planted and naturally regenerating forests.

Future meteorology was downscaled from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) ModelE General Circulation Model (GCM) to the regional scale using the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) model. We use emissions growth factors from the EPAUS9r MARKAL model to project emissions inventories for two climate tax scenarios, a combined transportation and energy scenario, a biomass energy scenario and a reference case. Implementation of a relatively aggressive carbon tax leads to improved PM2.5 air quality compared to the reference case as incentives increase for facilities to install flue-gas desulfurization (FGD) and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies. However, less capital is available to install NO reduction technologies, resulting in an O-3 increase. A policy aimed at reducing CO2 from the transportation sector and electricity production sectors leads to reduced emissions of mobile source NOX, thus reducing O-3. Over most of the U.S., this scenario leads to reduced PM2.5 concentrations. However, increased primary PM2.5 emissions associated with fuel switching in the residential and industrial sectors leads to increased organic matter (OM) and PM2.5 in some cities.",,Article,2015.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5879631042480469,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
4402775,Impacts of California’s climate-relevant land use policy scenarios on terrestrial carbon emissions (CO2 and CH4) and wildfire risk,"Land-use and -cover change (LUCC) is globally important to climate change mitigation. However, using land-based strategies to support aggressive subnational greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets is challenging due to competing land use priorities and uncertainty in ecosystem carbon dynamics and climate change effects. We used the California natural and working lands carbon and greenhouse gas model to quantify the direct ecosystem carbon emissions (CO2 and CH4) impacts, trade-offs, and climate change interactions of two policy scenarios identified by the State of California for fulfilling multiple land use goals, including the competing goals of mitigating wildfire severity and landscape carbon emissions, among others. Here we show that emissions from desired forest management to reduce the amount of combustible biomass (fuel reduction) initially outweighed emissions reductions from other strategies (e.g. less intensive forest management, restoration, land conservation); however, avoided emissions and enhanced carbon sequestration from the other strategies gradually outweighed fuel reduction emissions. Thus, in jurisdictions with large-scale wildfire mitigation goals, practices that reduce emissions and/or increase carbon sequestration can simultaneously offset fuel reduction emissions. Our analysis highlights the comp lexities inherent in LUCC planning, underscoring the need for governments to begin the task now. © 2021 The Author(s).

3961452,The Ethics of Geoengineering: A Literature Review,"Geoengineering as a technological intervention to avert the dangerous climate change has been on the table at least since 2006. The global outreach of the technology exercised in a non-encapsulated system, the concerns with unprecedented levels and scales of impact and the overarching interdisciplinarity of the project make the geoengineering debate ethically quite relevant and complex. This paper explores the ethical desirability of geoengineering from an overall review of the existing literature on the ethics of geoengineering. It identifies the relevant literature on the ethics of geoengineering by employing a standard methodology. Based on various framing of the major ethical arguments and their subsets, the results section presents the opportunities and challenges at stake in geoengineering from an ethical point of view. The discussion section takes a keen interest in identifying the evolving dynamics of the debate, the grey areas of the debate, with underdeveloped arguments being brought to the foreground and in highlighting the arguments that are likely to emerge in the future as key contenders. It observes the semantic diversity and ethical ambiguity, the academic lop-sidedness of the debate, missing contextual setting, need for interdisciplinary approaches, public engagement, and region-specific assessment of ethical issues. Recommendations are made to provide a useful platform for the second generation of geoengineering ethicists to help advance the debate to more decisive domains with the required clarity and caution.",Geoengineering; Ethics; Solar radiation management; Carbon dioxide removal; Negative emission; Justice; Research-ethics; Lesser evil; Moral hazard,Review,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5864475965499878,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
577192,A Policy-Driven Large Scale Ecological Restoration: Quantifying Ecosystem Services Changes in the Loess Plateau of China,"As one of the key tools for regulating human-ecosystem relations, environmental conservation policies can promote ecological rehabilitation across a variety of spatiotemporal scales. However, quantifying the ecological effects of such policies at the regional level is difficult. A case study was conducted at the regional level in the ecologically vulnerable region of the Loess Plateau, China, through the use of several methods including the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), hydrological modeling and multivariate analysis. An assessment of the changes over the period of 2000-2008 in four key ecosystem services was undertaken to determine the effects of the Chinese government's ecological rehabilitation initiatives implemented in 1999. These ecosystem services included water regulation, soil conservation, carbon sequestration and grain production. Significant conversions of farmland to woodland and grassland were found to have resulted in enhanced soil conservation and carbon sequestration, but decreased regional water yield under a warming and drying climate trend. The total grain production increased in spite of a significant decline in farmland acreage. These trends have been attributed to the strong socioeconomic incentives embedded in the ecological rehabilitation policy. Although some positive policy results have been achieved over the last decade, large uncertainty remains regarding long-term policy effects on the sustainability of ecological rehabilitation performance and ecosystem service enhancement. To reduce such uncertainty, this study calls for an adaptive management approach to regional ecological rehabilitation policy to be adopted, with a focus on the dynamic interactions between people and their environments in a changing world.",,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5862793326377869,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In addition, Chinese researchers were able to take part in a visiting scholar program to Australia and attend significant international carbon capture and storage (CCS) conferences. LAGS has promoted extensive knowledge sharing and networking between Chinese and Australian researchers, and has materially assisted in progressing the assessment of Chinese sedimentary basins for potential geological storage through products such as basin assessment criteria, guidelines for implementing regulation for geological storage, and raising the profile of geological storage among Chinese policy and decision makers.

Peatlands are one such environment in that they both sequester CO2 from the atmosphere and are also a major store of carbon. However, the world's peatlands are everywhere under threat. This includes in Ireland where, while still a feature of many rural areas, less than third of the country's original area of peatland remains intact. The sustainable management of the remaining peatland necessitates an action plan including the evidence by which to evaluate choices. It also requires an articulation of a vision for peatland in the decades to come. In this respect, peatlands are an environmental asset, but also a social and economic resource. Any framework for their management and restoration must be able to deal with the social and political decision making process and demonstrate a respect for the diverse range of public and private goods that peatlands provide.

Restoration interventions aim to increase functionality and resilience of landscapes, conserve biodiversity, store carbon, and mitigate effects of global climate change. We propose four principles to guide tree planting schemes focused on carbon storage and commercial forestry in the tropics in the context of FLR. These principles support activities and land uses that increase tree cover in human-modified landscapes, while also achieving positive socioecological outcomes at local scales, in an appropriate contextualization: (1) restoration interventions should enhance and diversify local livelihoods; (2) afforestation should not replace native tropical grasslands or savanna ecosystems; (3) reforestation approaches should promote landscape heterogeneity and biological diversity; and (4) residual carbon stocks should be quantitatively and qualitatively distinguished from newly established carbon stocks. The emerging global restoration movement and its growing international support provide strong momentum for increasing tree and forest cover in mosaic landscapes. The proposed principles help to establish a platform for FLR implementation and monitoring based on a broad set of socioenvironmental benefits including, but not solely restricted, to carbon mitigation and wood production.",carbon stock assessment; forest biomass; forest governance; forest regeneration; restoration accountability; tropical reforestation,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5823455452919006,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technologies appear among the most promising routes to the decarbonization process. We propose an equilibrium model where final-goods production uses labor and energy, and energy is generated using non-polluting RES and polluting fossil fuels. The government implements a Green Tax Reform (GTR), where it imposes a tax on emissions and uses revenues to finance subsidies to RES and support to CCS technologies. We test how results change according to the priority given to RES or to CCS support. Our results show that prioritizing RES support achieves better economic results and potentially also better environmental results. Overall, our empirical simulation demonstrates that resource substitution has a stronger benefit than decarbonizing fossil fuels.

This paper presents two descriptive scenarios for the development of the UK energy system to 2050, using four subsequent decadal time-slices. The two scenarios, K_Scenario and Z_Scenario, were modelled with the use of the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) 2050 Pathways Calculator. K_Scenario is a scenario in which the use fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage (CCS) are prominent in the power sector, while Z_Scenario focuses on the development of renewables with energy storage and nuclear power. Both scenarios seek to achieve the UK's legally binding target of an 80% reduction in GHG emissions from 1990 levels by 2050. Abatement is achieved through numerous developments in each of the scenarios, including the development and use of shale gas, hydrogen, additional wind and solar deployment, the expansion of bioenergy and use of carbon capture and storage (CCS). These developments must be driven by policies designed to pursue dramatic decarbonisation. (C) 2015 The Authors.

897733,Negative emissions technologies and carbon capture and storage to achieve the Paris Agreement commitments,"How will the global atmosphere and climate be protected? Achieving net-zero CO2 emissions will require carbon capture and storage (CCS) to reduce current GHG emission rates, and negative emissions technology (NET) to recapture previously emitted greenhouse gases. Delivering NET requires radical cost and regulatory innovation to impact on climate mitigation. Present NET exemplars are few, are at small-scale and not deployable within a decade, with the exception of rock weathering, or direct injection of CO2 into selected ocean water masses. To keep warming less than 2 degrees C, bioenergy with CCS (BECCS) has been modelled but does not yet exist at industrial scale. CCS already exists in many forms and at low cost. However, CCS has no political drivers to enforce its deployment. We make a new analysis of all global CCS projects and model the build rate out to 2050, deducing this is 100 times too slow. Our projection to 2050 captures just 700 Mt CO2 yr(-1), not the minimum 6000 Mt CO2 yr(-1) required to meet the 2 degrees C target. Hence new policies are needed to incentivize commercial CCS. A first urgent action for all countries is to commercially assess their CO2 storage. A second simple action is to assign a Certificate of CO2 Storage onto producers of fossil carbon, mandating a progressively increasing proportion of CO2 to be stored. No CCS means no 2 degrees C.

3959866,An equitable redistribution of unburnable carbon,"The rapid phase-out of fossil fuels is critical to achieving a well-below 2 degrees C world. An emerging body of research explores the implications of this phase-out for fossil fuel producing countries, including the perceived tension between least-cost and most-equitable pathways. Here we present modelling, which re-distributes remaining fossil fuel production towards developing countries. We show that redistribution is challenging due to large economic disincentives required to shift production, and offers limited economic benefit for developing countries given the long timeframe required to effect change, and the wider impact of rising fuel import and energy systems costs. Furthermore, increases in production shares are offset by shrinking markets for fossil fuels, which are part dependent on carbon capture and storage (CCS). We argue that while there is a weak economic case for redistribution, there is a clear role for equity principles in guiding the development of supply side policy and in development assistance. The allocation of remaining fossil fuel production has stimulated a discussion around issues of equitable allocation but the implications of different options are unclear.

426231,Review of the plain afforestation policy in sustainable community development,"The level of CO2 emissions in Taiwan is high. The pressure of future international carbon trading taxes has prompted Taiwan to promote numerous subsidy policies to reduce high CO2 emissions and solve this problem, such as the plain afforestation policy. Taiwan 's Forestry Bureau and Agriculture Bureau currently subsidize the transformation of fallow or inactive farmland into forests that absorb and sequester carbon from the atmosphere; the overall NTD$ 2.4 mln (approximately US$ 80,000) subsidy has a 20 years term. Thus, plain afforestation policies simultaneously reduce atmospheric carbon concentrations and increase the income of farmers. The problem is that subsidies for farmers cease after 20 years and leave them without any guarantees, causing the loss of benefits generated by forest carbon sequestering. In this study, combine the Delphi method, analytical hierarchy process (AHP), and the utility theory to establish the DAHP-Utility model and consider factors that influence the attitudes of farmers, the effectiveness of government policy, and forest growth to develop a carbon sequestering markup effect function. This function calculates the carbon sequestering markup value that increases farmers ' additional subsidies.

107493,Ecological and Social Dimensions of Ecosystem Restoration in the Nordic Countries,"An international overview of the extent and type of ecological restoration can offer new perspectives for understanding, planning, and implementation. The Nordic countries, with a great range of natural conditions but historically similar social and political structures, provide an opportunity to compare restoration approaches and efforts across borders. The aim of this study was to explore variation in ecological restoration using the Nordic countries as an example. We used recent national assessments and expert evaluations of ecological restoration. Restoration efforts differed among countries: forest and peatland restoration was most common in Finland, freshwater restoration was most common in Sweden, restoration of natural heathlands and grasslands was most common in Iceland, restoration of natural and semi-cultural heathlands was most common in Norway, and restoration of cultural ecosystems, mainly abandoned agricultural land, was most common in Denmark. Ecological restoration currently does not occur on the Faroe Islands. Economic incentives influence ecological restoration and depend on laws and policies in each country. Our analyses suggest that habitat types determine the methods of ecological restoration, whereas socio-economic drivers are more important for the decisions concerning the timing and location of restoration. To improve the understanding, planning, and implementation of ecological restoration, we advocate increased cooperation and knowledge sharing across disciplines and among countries, both in the Nordic countries and internationally. An obvious advantage of such cooperation is that a wider range of experiences from different habitats and different socio-economic conditions becomes available and thus provides a more solid basis for developing practical solutions for restoration methods and policies.",economic incentives; habitats; land use pressure; northern Europe; regional scale; restoration efforts,Article,2013.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5780920386314392,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Despite funding opportunities to support afforestation on private land, some of these regions do not succeed in enhancing their forest area. The objective of this study is to explore the institutional, economic and ecological conditions that would encourage farmers to enrol in an agri-environmental scheme for afforestation in Saxony, Germany. Using choice experiments and qualitative interviews, farmers' demand for varying contract designs is estimated. The findings show that farmers have a strong disutility for large forests and long contracts and would be willing to receive less subsidy if they receive technical forest management advice and have the opportunity to return to agricultural land-uses after the contract ends. Biodiversity and ecosystem service related factors (species' diversity, timber production and recreational access) do not significantly influence farmers' choices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

668992,Soil erosion and conservation in northern Europe,"Soil conservation policies are suggested at national, regional and local levels, including adoption and modification of several Australian, European and North American policies. The Australian Landcare system and programmes of the US Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) are particularly informative. Several European initiatives are promising models, including the strategies of the Danish Land Development Service (Hedeselskabet) and the Icelandic Soil Conservation Service (Landsgraedsla Rikisins). The Erosienormeringsprojekt of South Limburg (The Netherlands) is a coordinated and integrated soil conservation project and seems a particularly useful model for future soil conservation in northern Europe. Several best management practices for soil conservation are identified. These include the promotion of soil conservation by a properly funded and relatively well known soil conservation service and full mapping, monitoring and costing of erosion risk by national soil survey organizations. A participatory approach to soil conservation should be adopted, involving farmers and interested members of the public, and there should be a 'cost share' partnership between government and farmers in funding conservation work on farms. Rational land-use policies need to be developed, such as the promotion of 'set-aside' on erodible soils, grass strips on arable slopes and buffer strips in riparian zones. Education programmes are necessary to actively inform the public on the importance of soil as a resource. These schemes should particularly encourage 'land literacy' among participants. It is imperative that the broader societal benefits of effective soil conservation are recognized, such as its potential contribution to habitat creation, biodiversity and carbon sequestration.",Landcare; land literacy; northern Europe; soil conservation; soil erosion,Article,2003.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5762679576873779,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
4914110,A simple model for assessing climate control trade-offs and responding to unanticipated climate outcomes,"Persistent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions threaten global climate goals and have prompted consideration of climate controls supplementary to emissions mitigation. We present MARGO, an idealized model of optimally-controlled climate change, which is complementary to both simpler conceptual models and more complicated Integrated Assessment Models. The four methods of controlling climate damage-mitigation, carbon dioxide removal (CDR), adaptation, and solar radiation modification (SRM)-are not interchangeable, as they enter at different stages of the causal chain that connects GHG emissions to climate damages. Early and aggressive mitigation is necessary to stabilize GHG concentrations below a tolerable level. While the most cost-beneficial and cost-effective pathways to reducing climate suffering include deployments of all four controls, the quantitative trade-offs between the different controls are sensitive to value-driven parameters and poorly-known future costs and damages. Static policy optimization assumes perfect foresight and obscures the active role decision-makers have in shaping a climate trajectory. We propose an explicit policy response process wherein climate control policies are re-adjusted over time in response to unanticipated outcomes. We illustrate this process in two 'storyline' scenarios: (a) near-term increases in mitigation and CDR are deficient, such that climate goals are expected to slip out of reach; (b) SRM is abruptly terminated after 40 years of successful deployment, causing an extremely rapid warming which is amplified by an excess of GHGs due to deterred mitigation. In both cases, an optimized policy response yields substantial benefits relative to continuing the original policy. The MARGO model is intentionally designed to be as simple, transparent, customizable, and accessible as possible, addressing concerns about previous climate-economic modelling approaches and enabling a more diverse set of stakeholders to engage with these essential and timely topics.",climate policy; geoengineering; carbon dioxide removal; mitigation; adaptation; climate change,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5758424401283264,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
757811,China's energy system transformation towards the 2 degrees C goal: Implications of different effort-sharing principles,"In coping with climate change, China's CO2 mitigation targets should keep in step with the achievement of the long-term goal of holding temperature increase to well below 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels by the end of this century (this is referred to as the 2 degrees C goal). Many previous papers have highlighted the implications of different effort-sharing principles and schemes in determining national contributions to global mitigations. In this paper, China's energy transformation towards the 2 degrees C goal until 2100 is examined in an integrated-assessment model in light of different effort-sharing principles to understand how the application of such schemes may alter China's energy system transformation on a pathway to this long-term goal. Across scenarios, China's non-fossil energy will account for 50-70% and 85% of primary energy consumption in 2050 and 2100, respectively in the scenarios in this study. Fossil energy with carbon capture and storage technologies and non-fossil energy will dominate power generation in China over the long run. Coal will be phased out in end-use sectors and electricity use will expand regardless of the effort-sharing principles. The sensitivity analysis of long-term steady-state levels implies that the ultimate level that emissions could reach will have great influences on the energy system transformation in China.",China; Energy system transformation; INDC; Carbon budgets; Effort-sharing,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.575107216835022,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

A whole systems justice milieu of twenty negative emissions and solar geoengineering technologies,"In this study, we utilize a large and diverse expert interview exercise (N = 125) to critically examine the whole systems justice issues associated with ten negative emissions and ten solar geoengineering technologies. We ask: What equity and justice concerns arise with these 20 options? What particular vulnerable groups could be affected? What risks do these options entail for communities or the climate? Utilizing a “claims making” approach, we examine existing and prospective injustices across a pluralistic whole systems framework analyzing (i) resource extraction issues including minerals, chemicals, and fertilizers (ii) manufacturing, labor and ownership concerns, (iii) transportation-network and land-grabbing dynamics, (iv) unfair and exclusionary policymaking and planning, (v) operational injustices resulting from deployment and use, and (vi) waste flows, liabilities and disposal requirements. We then explore how these potential concerns culminate in a milieu of injustice cutting across the dimensions of distribution (who gets what), recognition (who counts), participation (who gets heard), capabilities (what matters), and responsibility (who does what).

602674,NER300: Lessons learnt in attempting to secure CCS projects in Europe,"CO2 Capture and Storage (CCS) has become an integral and priority part of European energy policy over the last years. However, CCS is not a feasible climate change mitigation option yet. In order to bring the technology towards reduced costs and to make CCS an economically viable mitigation option, the European Commission created a comprehensive demonstration programme aimed to encourage development and accelerate commercial CCS deployment. The goal was to have up to 12 CCS demonstration projects by 2015. This is far away from reality today. Despite the tremendous effort, the two major European CCS funds - the European Energy Programme for Recovery and more recently the New Entrants Reserve of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme Programme (NER300) - are struggling to secure a single demonstration project to move forward. Originally intended as a CCS instrument, the NER300 first round published on November 2010 has been followed with great expectation by CCS community. However, in December 2012 the Commission announced that not one CCS project was awarded. This paper reviews the NER300 process, analyses the reasons for the programme's lack of success in securing CCS demonstration projects, and distills the lessons learnt. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

2114684,Understanding and improving NGO position on CCS,"The importance of public acceptance of CCS has been highlighted by developers and policy makers, with all emphasising that it is a fundamental factor in the future success of CCS. However, little research has been done so far on NGO positioning on CCS. The current debate in Europe, with discussion beginning to result in both real projects on the ground and in real policies, has put NGOs more and more into a position of making open stands. This has resulted in a diversity of viewpoints, and the controv ersy has polarized opinions. In this paper we review our own research on NGO opinions on CCS, to spell out their most important concerns. We discuss NGO positioning vis-a-vis the ongoing negotiations of a legislative proposal to regulate CCS in Europe. Fin ally, we consider whether it is possible to come to more coherent approaches and agreements in a way that maximizes their effectiveness both as a counterweight to, and partner of, other stakeholders and governments.

3776262,Barriers and Strategies to Boost Soil Carbon Sequestration in Agriculture,"The Paris Agreement calls for limiting global warming below 2 degrees C. The ""4 per 1,000 Initiative: Soils for food security and climate"" was launched in 2015 to increase soil organic carbon sequestration with three objectives: mitigation of climate change, adaptation to climate change and improved food security. One of the challenges of the Initiative relates to its feasibility in contrasted biophysical, social and economic environments, questioning the adoption rate of required new practices. We conducted participatory multi-stakeholder workshops in France and Senegal to collect knowledge and perception of farmers, NGOs, agro-industries, administrations, donors and researchers on barriers and coping strategies for 4 per 1,000 innovations. Results in both countries reveal the predominance of social and economic barriers such as lack of knowledge or training, increased difficulties of fieldwork, workload, risk handling, funding and social pressure. Biophysical constraints such as limited potential of soil organic matter storage or rainfall scarcity and variability appear more important in Senegal. Identified actions to foster the sequestration of soil carbon call for an improved policy context leading to innovations in land planning, stakeholder communication, demonstration facilities, capacity building or financial support. Fewer constraints and coping strategies mention technical issues, showing that fostering agricultural soil carbon sequestration is more a question of enabling environment than technical innovations or farmers' willingness for change. We conclude that actions to support the 4 per 1,000 Initiative need to include a variety of stakeholders such as extension services, private sector, civil society, local institutions, policy makers, consumers, and not only farmers.",climate change mitigation; climate change adaptation; food security; innovation; policy; stakeholders; territory,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5743255019187927,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
4913196,"Ten golden rules for reforestation to optimize carbon sequestration, biodiversity recovery and livelihood benefits","Urgent solutions to global climate change are needed. Ambitious tree-planting initiatives, many already underway, aim to sequester enormous quantities of carbon to partly compensate for anthropogenic CO2 emissions, which are a major cause of rising global temperatures. However, tree planting that is poorly planned and executed could actually increase CO2 emissions and have long-term, deleterious impacts on biodiversity, landscapes and livelihoods. Here, we highlight the main environmental risks of large-scale tree planting and propose 10 golden rules, based on some of the most recent ecological research, to implement forest ecosystem restoration that maximizes rates of both carbon sequestration and biodiversity recovery while improving livelihoods. These are as follows: (1) Protect existing forest first; (2) Work together (involving all stakeholders); (3) Aim to maximize biodiversity recovery to meet multiple goals; (4) Select appropriate areas for restoration; (5) Use natural regeneration wherever possible; (6) Select species to maximize biodiversity; (7) Use resilient plant material (with appropriate genetic variability and provenance); (8) Plan ahead for infrastructure, capacity and seed supply; (9) Learn by doing (using an adaptive management approach); and (10) Make it pay (ensuring the economic sustainability of the project). We focus on the design of long-term strategies to tackle the climate and biodiversity crises and support livelihood needs. We emphasize the role of local communities as sources of indigenous knowledge, and the benefits they could derive from successful reforestation that restores ecosystem functioning and delivers a diverse range of forest products and services. While there is no simple and universal recipe for forest restoration, it is crucial to build upon the currently growing public and private interest in this topic, to ensure interventions provide effective, long-term carbon sinks and maximize benefits for biodiversity and people.",afforestation; climate-change mitigation; ecological restoration; forest landscape restoration; large-scale tree planting; natural regeneration; nature-based solutions; stakeholder participation,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5735729932785034,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The roadmap comprises 26 actions which need to be implemented within the next ten years. The actions address five different CCS themes or issues which need to be covered to successfully implement large-scale CCS. The roadmap has been established in close cooperation with main CCS stakeholders. As guidance for the roadmap, a vision on CCS in the Netherlands for 2050 has been developed. The vision depicts the view of the stakeholders on the role of CCS in the energy system. This roadmap can serve as a solid foundation for CCS stakeholders from both industry and government but also from universities and research institutes to define their next activities. The government can make use of it by defining their short and medium-term CCS action plan. The roadmap is presented in an interactive form on a website that allows stakeholders to directly find relevant information on the actions and background information. (C) 2014 The Authors.

614829,Greenhouse-gas-trading markets,"This paper summarizes the extension of new market mechanisms for environmental services, explains of the importance of generating price information indicative of the cost of mitigating greenhouse gases (GHGs) and presents the rationale and objectives for pilot GHG-trading markets. It also describes the steps being taken to define and launch pilot carbon markets in North America and Europe and reviews the key issues related to incorporating carbon sequestration into an emissions-trading market. There is an emerging consensus to employ market mechanisms to help address the threat of human-induced climate changes. Carbon-trading markets are now in development around the world. A UK market is set to launch in 2002, and the European Commission has called for a 2005 launch of an European Union (EU)-wide market, and a voluntary carbon market is now in formation in North America. These markets represent an initial step in resolving a fundamental problem in defining and implementing appropriate policy actions to address climate change. Policymakers currently suffer from two major information gaps: the economic value of potential damages arising from climate changes are highly uncertain, and there is a lack of reliable information on the cost of mitigating GHGs. These twin gaps significantly reduce the quality of the climate policy debate. The Chicago Climate Exchange, for which the authors serve as lead designers, is intended to provide an organized carbon-trading market involving energy, industry and carbon sequestration in forests and farms. Trading among these diverse sectors will provide price discovery that will help clarify the cost of combating climate change when a wide range of mitigation options is employed. By closing the information gap on mitigation costs, society and policymakers will be far better prepared to identify and implement optimal policies for managing the risks associated with climate change. Establishment of practical experience in providing tradeable credits for carbon-absorbing land-use practices, especially reforestation and conservation management of agricultural soils, will also help demonstrate the viability of a new tool for financing activities that improve water quality, support biodiversity and constitute important elements of long-term sustainability in land-use management.",climate change; emissions trading; carbon-trading market; carbon sequestration; offset projects,Article,2002.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5722454786300659,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
637923,China's role in attaining the global 2 degrees C target,"In the recent climate change negotiations it was declared that the increase in global temperature should be kept below 2 degrees C by 2100, relative to pre-industrial levels. China's CO2 emissions from energy and cement processes already account for nearly 24% of global emissions, a trend that is expected to keep increasing. Thus the role of China in global GHG mitigation is crucial. A scenario analysis of China's CO2 emissions is presented here and the feasibility of China reaching a low-carbon scenario is discussed. The results suggest that recent and continued technological progress will make it possible for China to limit its CO2 emissions and for these emissions to peak before 2025 and therefore that the global 2 degrees C target can be achieved. Policy relevance In signing the Copenhagen Accord, China agreed to the global 2 degrees C target. Results from this article could be used to justify low-carbon development policies and negotiations. While many still doubt the feasibility of a low-carbon pathway to support the global 2 degrees C target, the results suggest that such a pathway can be realistically achieved. This conclusion should increase confidence and guide the policy framework further to make possible China's low-carbon development. Related policies and measures, such as renewable energy development, energy efficiency, economic structure optimization, technology innovation, low-carbon investment, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) development, should be further enhanced. Furthermore, China can play a larger role in the international negotiations process.

571976,"Forest cover, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat: policy review and modeling of tradeoffs among land-use change scenarios","Local and regional governments have developed climate action plans with significant implications for forests and wildlife. The effectiveness of climate mitigation through forest carbon sequestration depends on understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of land-cover and land-use change (LCLUC). Few studies project future LCLUC effects on forest carbon sequestration, and even fewer examine the resulting consequences for forest connectivity and wildlife habitat. First, we asked what forest-relevant climate mitigation strategies have been identified in US state climate mitigation plans, and do they consider implications for wildlife habitat and forest connectivity? Second, for Wisconsin, a partially forested state, what are the effects of three future LCLUC scenarios on afforestation, forest loss, carbon sequestration and storage, forest connectivity, and wildlife habitat? The 35 US states with climate mitigation plans recommended woody biomass for biofuels or energy production (27 states), forest loss prevention (24 states), and afforestation (17 states). Most plans (24 states) anticipated positive wildlife impacts while 7 plans indicated potential negative wildlife impacts from biomass energy; only 3 plans anticipated tradeoffs among afforestation and energy production. A LCLUC model for Wisconsin revealed substantial local variation in potential afforestation and forest loss, carbon sequestration, and wildlife habitat across LCLUC scenarios that range from no change in current conditions (Static Forest) to maximum afforestation potential (All Forest). Projected increases in forest cover under the Dynamic Forest scenario equated to 0.41 TgC sequestered per year, or 1.3% of Wisconsin's emissions of 33 TgC per year. Potential increases in core forest area and connectivity would increase habitat for 60 forest-associated species of greatest conservation need, but may decrease habitat for 48 grassland-associated species of greatest conservation need. These results indicate the importance of synergistic evaluation of multiple policy goals and LCLUC scenarios to examine tradeoffs and spatial dynamics of climate change mitigation strategies.

The Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSPs) are the mechanism DOE utilizes to prove the technology and to develop human capital, stakeholder networks, information for regulatory policy, best practices documents and training to work toward the commercialization of carbon capture and storage (CCS). The RCSPs are tasked with determining the most suitable technologies, regulations, and infrastructure for carbon capture, transport, and storage in their respective geographic areas of responsibility. The seven partnerships include more than 400 state agencies, universities, national laboratories, private companies, and environmental organizations, spanning 43 states and four Canadian provinces. The Regional Partnerships Initiative is being implemented in three phases: Characterization, Validation, and Development. The initial Characterization Phase began in 2003 and was completed in 2005 and focused on characterization of CO2 storage potential within each region. It was followed by the Validation Phase, which began in 2005 and is nearing completion in 2011. The focus of the Validation Phase has been on small-scale field tests throughout the seven partnerships in various formation types such as saline, oil-bearing, and coal seams. The Validation Phase has characterized suitable CO2 storage reservoirs and identified the need for comprehensive legal and regulatory frameworks to enable commercial-scale CCS deployment. Finally, the Development Phase will consist of a series of large-scale, one-million-ton, injection tests throughout the United States and Canada. The objective of these large-scale tests is to identify the regulatory path or challenges in permitting CCS projects, to demonstrate the technology can inject CO2 safely, and to verify its permanence in geologic formations in preparation for the commercialization of geologic sequestration. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

726049,The screening and scoping of Environmental Impact Assessment and Strategic Environmental Assessment of Carbon Capture and Storage in the Netherlands,"The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) are procedural tools which have as goal to assess and evaluate possible environmental effects of, respectively, a proposed project or policy plan. The goal of this article is to explore possible bottlenecks in applying both the EIA and SEA procedures on Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) activities in the Netherlands, as experience is currently minimal or lacking. In this study we focus mainly on the institutional and procedural aspects of the screening and scoping phases of both procedures. This is achieved by reviewing EIA and SEA procedures for analogue projects for the three distinctive process steps of a CCS project, namely the power plant with capture, the transport and finally the underground storage of the CO2. Additionally, EIA and SEA or similar procedures on CCS in other countries are reviewed and the legal framework for the Dutch EIA and SEA is studied. This article shows a concise overview of the EIA and SEA procedure in the Netherlands and the relation between both procedures. Based on our findings we have constructed a conceptual taxonomy for the scope of both procedures for CCS in the Netherlands. This taxonomy conceptualizes the possible integration of assessing the environmental impacts for tiered levels of decision making. This integration might be needed for first CCS projects as decisions on the strategic (spatial planning) level are currently absent for CCS in the Netherlands. Perpendicular to such integration is the integration of linked activities in the CCS chain and their alternatives, into one procedure. We argue that it would be beneficial to combine the separate EIA procedures for CCS activities into one procedure or at least provide close linkage between them. This issue should be carefully considered by regulators, competent authorities and project initiators in an early stage to avoid delaying legal procedures in the future. For the same reason also early involvement of public, interested parties and the Netherlands Commission for the Environmental Impact Assessment in the scoping phase of the procedures is desired.

366303,Alternative approaches for addressing non-permanence in carbon projects: an application to afforestation and reforestation under the Clean Development Mechanism,"Afforestation and reforestation (A/R) projects generate greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction credits by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through biophysical processes and storing it in terrestrial carbon stocks. One feature of A/R activities is the possibility of non-permanence, in which stored carbon is lost though natural or anthropogenic disturbances. The risk of non-permanence is currently addressed in Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) A/R projects through temporary carbon credits. To evaluate other approaches to address reversals and their implications for policy and investment decisions, we assess the performance of multiple policy and accounting mechanisms using a forest ecosystem simulation model parameterized with observational data on natural disturbances (e.g., fire and wind). Our analysis finds that location, project scale, and system dynamics all affect the performance of different risk mechanisms. We also find that there is power in risk diversification. Risk management mechanisms likewise exhibit a range of features and tradeoffs among risk conservatism, economic returns, and other factors. Rather than relying on a single approach, a menu-based system could be developed to provide entities the flexibility to choose among approaches, but care must be taken to avoid issues of adverse selection.",Afforestation; Carbon; Clean Development Mechanism; Insurance; Non-permanence; Reforestation; Temporary credit,Article,2016.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5710458159446716,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
651503,Examining the Role of Carbon Capture and Storage Through an Ethical Lens,"The risk posed by anthropogenic climate change is generally accepted, and the challenge we face to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to a tolerable limit cannot be underestimated. Reducing GHG emissions can be achieved either by producing less GHG to begin with or by emitting less GHG into the atmosphere. One carbon mitigation technology with large potential for capturing carbon dioxide at the point source of emissions is carbon capture and storage (CCS). However, the merits of CCS have been questioned, both on practical and ethical grounds. While the practical concerns have already received substantial attention, the ethical concerns still demand further consideration. This article aims to respond to this deficit by reviewing the critical ethical challenges raised by CCS as a possible tool in a climate mitigation strategy and argues that the urgency stemming from climate change underpins many of the concerns raised by CCS.",CCS; Climate change; Ethics; Intergenerational justice; Mitigation; Responsibility; Risk,Article,2014.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5703415274620056,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
923437,A Critical Examination of Geoengineering: Economic and Technological Rationality in Social Context,"Geoengineeringspecifically stratospheric aerosol injectionis not only risky, but supports powerful economic interests, protects an inherently ecologically harmful social formation, relegates the fundamental social-structural changes needed to address climate change, and is rooted in a vision of a nature as a set of passive resources that can be fully controlled in line with the demands of capital. The case for geoengineering is incomprehensible without analyzing the social context that gave birth to it: capitalism's inability to overcome a contradiction between the need to accumulate capital, on the one hand, and the need to maintain a stable climate system on the other. Substantial emissions reductions, unlike geoengineering, are costly, rely more on social-structural than technical changes, and are at odds with the current social order. Because of this, geoengineering will increasingly be considered a core response to climate change. In light of Herbert Marcuse's critical theory, the promotion of geoengineering as a market-friendly and high-tech strategy is shown to reflect a society that cannot set substantive aims through reason and transforms what should be considered means (technology and economic production) into ends themselves.

787183,Challenges for social impact assessment in coastal regions: A case study of the Tomakomai CCS Demonstration Project,"This paper assesses challenges for social impact assessment (SIA) for coastal and offshore infrastructure projects, using the case study of the Tomakomai Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) Demonstration Project in Hokkaido, Japan. Interest in SIA and linked concepts such as social licence to operate is growing, yet marine environments also have potential to raise additional complexity in project governance. Drawing on qualitative research conducted in Tomakomai and Japan more widely across the project development and implementation phase, the paper argues that building an understanding of the social, cultural and historical relationship between the community, industry and the sea is crucial to understanding the neutral or cautiously supportive response of the citizens and stakeholders in Tomakomai to the project. Moreover, effective SIA in coastal regions needs to find a way to account for or at least make visible these complex relations between society and the sea. Based on the findings, it is suggested that developers or policymakers overseeing SIA in coastal regions ought to pay extra attention to the extent to which developments like CCS are viewed by communities as 'new' as opposed to a continuation of existing activities in the sea; to the importance of engagement on monitoring during the project operations phase; and to the non-economic values such as pride and identity which communities and stakeholders may derive from the sea.",Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Coastal communities; Social impact assessment; Social licence to operate; Tomakomai CCS Demonstration Project,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5665885210037231,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
414844,The social meaning of carbon dioxide emission trading: Institutional capacity building for a green market in Costa Rica,"Forests offer good possibilities for the sequestration of carbon dioxide. This service can be commodified by the introduction of carbon (dioxide) credits, which can be traded on a carbon market. The premise of this paper is that the traditional economic view on the construction of these carbon markets is a too simplistic one, particularly, because it neglects the social meaning of a carbon market for developing countries. From their viewpoint as suppliers of carbon credits such a market has a broader meaning. It must be seen as a social mechanism for improving both the living conditions of local people and a more encompassing improvement of the environment than climate as such. What initially might be labelled as a carbon market might better be understood as a more encompassing 'green market'. The agreement between Costa Rica and Norway, officially known as the Reforestation Conservation Activities Implemented Jointly Project (RFCAIJP) represents a clear example of a green market. In this paper, we study the development, characteristics and benefits of that market, asking the question what lessons can be learned from this first practical experiences.

5268410,Blue Carbon in Emissions Markets: Challenges and Opportunities for Mexico,"Mangroves are ecosystems made up of trees or shrubs that develop in the intertidal zone and provide many vital environmental services for livelihoods in coastal areas. They are a habitat for the reproduction of several marine species. They afford protection from hurricanes, tides, sea-level rise and prevent the erosion of the coasts. Just one hectare of mangrove forest can hold up to 1,000 tons of carbon dioxide, more than tropical forests and jungles. Mexico is one of the countries with the greatest abundance of mangroves in the world, with more than 700,000 ha. Blue carbon can be a novel mechanism for promoting communication and cooperation between the investor, the government, the users, and beneficiaries of the environmental services of these ecosystems, creating public–private-social partnerships through mechanisms such as payment for environmental services, credits, or the voluntary carbon market. This chapter explores the possibilities of incorporating blue carbon in emissions markets. We explore the huge potential of Mexico’s blue carbon to sequester CO2. Then we analyse the new market instrument that allows countries to sell or transfer mitigation results internationally: The Sustainable Development Mechanism (SDM), established in the Paris Agreement. Secondly, we present the progress of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) to standardize the methodologies to assess their stock and determine the magnitude of the blue carbon sinks. Thirdly, as an opportunity for Mexico, the collaboration with the California cap-and-trade program is analysed. We conclude that blue carbon is a very important mitigation tool to be included in the compensation schemes on regional and global levels. Additionally, mangrove protection is an excellent example of the mitigation-adaptation-sustainable development relationship, as well as fostering of governance by the inclusion of the coastal communities in decision-making and incomes. © 2022, The Author(s).",,Book Chapter,2022.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5661547780036926,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This paper reviews its assessments of bioenergy, geothermal, hydropower, ocean energy, solar, wind, nuclear, and carbon capture and storage (CCS), respectively, over that period. The assessments of hydropower, nuclear, and geothermal tend to focus on the social, economic, and environmental considerations that inhibit expansion of these mature technologies. The assessments of bioenergy, solar, and wind reflect their technological progress and market penetration. Assessments of ocean energy and CCS conclude they are likely to make only a modest contribution to mitigation efforts by 2030.

Model results show that the method of tax revenue recycling makes a difference. Either labor-tax, or capital-tax, recycling can reduce the welfare cost of a carbon tax policy relative to lump sum recycling. Of the two tax recycling options, reducing capital taxes provides the greater reduction in welfare costs. However, carbon tax revenues decline with stringent carbon dioxide (CO2) emission targets and the availability of a negative-emissions technology such as bio-electricity with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS). As BECCS expands, net carbon tax revenues peak and decline due to an offsetting subsidy for carbon sequestration, limiting the potential for labor- or capital-tax recycling to reduce welfare costs of a climate policy.",Bio-electricity; carbon tax; climate policy; greenhouse gas; negative emissions; revenue recycling,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5651516914367676,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
622550,The development and deployment of low-carbon energy technologies: The role of economic interests and cultural worldviews on public support,"Large-scale deployment of low-carbon energy technologies is crucial to mitigating climate change, and public support is an important barrier to policies and projects that facilitate deployment. This paper provides insights to the origins of public opposition that can impede the adoption of low-carbon technologies by investigating how perceptions are shaped by local economic interests and individual cultural worldviews. The research considers both carbon capture and storage and wind energy technologies because they differ in maturity, economic impact and resource base. Further, for each technology, the research examines support for two types of policies: deployment in local community and public funding for research and development. Results indicate the influence of economic interests and cultural worldviews is policy specific. Individual cultural worldviews do not affect support for the deployment of technology, but they do significantly influence a person's support for publicly funded research and development. Conversely, local economic interests have a significant role in determining support for deployment, while they do not affect support for research and development. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2390801,Blue carbon in area-based coastal and marine management schemes - a review,"Blue carbon ecosystems are diverse and highly productive coastal habitats (mangroves, seagrasses, and tidal marshes) that sequester large quantities of carbon and provide a suite of important ecosystem services (co-benefits') for humans and the environment. These ecosystems are being threatened globally due to land-use change driven by expanding agriculture, aquaculture, coastal development, and pollution. Climatic impacts further threaten the resilience, functionality, and adaptability of blue carbon ecosystems. Marine protected areas' (MPAs) provide a statutory approach for protecting coastal and marine ecosystems, yet are unlikely to meet additionality' requirements. Whereas other effective conservation measures (OECMs) including community-based locally managed marine areas' (LMMAs) provide opportunities to enhance blue carbon conservation and restoration efforts.

Using concepts from Bernard Stiegler to interrogate ethnographic data, this article argues that forestry drones are pharmaka: their biopolitics can be therapeutic, that is, negentropic, capable of reversing ecological simplification. Drone forestry is a type of arborescent governmentality, a tree-based computer-coded attempt to control the growth of a forest. For the Colville, this negentropy is also an act of sovereignty that protects culture and honors multispecies relationships. For DroneSeed, it is an experiment in negentropic geoengineering, an attempt to profitably leverage technologies and biological regeneration to sequester carbon and reduce global existential risk. Ultimately the project was not the success desired; the failure of technoliberal projects that blend ecological and economic liberalism shows that a more radical approach might be necessary to root carbon and slow capitalism. © The Author(s) 2022.",,Article,2022.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5634703636169434,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

898140,The transboundary displacement of deforestation under REDD plus : Problematic intersections between the trade of forest-risk commodities and land grabbing in the Mekong region,"A key lever to mitigate global climate change is the reversal of forest carbon emissions trends throughout the Global South. Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) initiatives seek to conserve forest carbon stocks primarily through national and sub-national policies and interventions. Dominant drivers of forest change are, however, increasingly international in scope, tied to global commodity markets and investment flows, and are not easily captured or effectively addressed through nation-based carbon accounting. The fragmentary adoption of REDD + across forest nations leaves room for the displacement of deforestation from early-adopters and countries with more rigorous carbon-related regulatory regimes to late-adopters of REDD +. While this displacement is expected to be substantial, our empirical understanding of the causal pathways of transboundary displacement remains weak. Our research addresses this lacuna, focusing on Vietnam, an early adopter of REDD + that has experienced significant reforestation despite exponential growth in exports of key forest-risk commodities, sourced in large part from Lao PDR and Cambodia. We show that over the last decade, the trade of forest-risk commodities was large and accelerating in the Mekong region, concurrent with the rapid expansion of large-scale land acquisitions (LSLAs), constituting important, inter-related causal pathways for the displacement of deforestation and forest degradation. LSLAs are, however, core of national economic development strategies in the Mekong region, indicating a problematic relationship between REDD +, trade flows and land and forest governance. We explore the problematic intersection between these dynamic processes, their impacts on forests in Lao PDR and Cambodia, and implications for global efforts to manage forest resources and reduce emissions. The inability of REDD + to address transboundary impacts suggests the need for complementary interventions that address supply- and demand-side dynamics.",REDD; Transboundary displacement; Forest governance; Land grabbing; Lao PDR and Cambodia,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5618225336074829,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
208648,Economic and policy evaluation of SPCC (solar-assisted post-combustion carbon capture) in Australia,"This paper evaluates the economic feasibility of SPCC (solar-assisted post-combustion carbon capture) at a coal power plant near Sydney, Townsville and Melbourne for implementation in 2020. A review of Australia's carbon and renewable energy policy is performed first, after which the merits of application of each incentive for SPCC are compared. Incentives such as subsidies, preferential discount rate, carbon tax and RECs (renewable energy certificates) are evaluated. No single incentive on its own, and within reasonable limits, is able to provide a favourable economic performance for power plant based renewable powered CCS (carbon capture and storage). However, once the compounded effect of carbon tax and electricity price increase is taken into account, a carbon price as low as A$ 25/tonne-CO2 and a REC price as low as A$ 35/MWh(e) is able to produce a positive net benefit in Townsville, while a slightly higher carbon price and REC price is required for Sydney. Melbourne performs poorest amongst the three locations, where substantially higher incentives would be needed for economic feasibility. The level of incentives required for SPCC to become feasible are found to fall in the range of current Australian policy incentives accessible to renewable energy technologies for stand-alone power generation.

The scheme is guided by two design principles: to ensure environmental integrity; and to enable broad participation. The CFI incorporates a number of strong environmental integrity features, many of which represent significant improvements comparative to the Clean Develop- ment Mechanism. The scheme also addresses the economic issues specific to the agricultural industry to enable participation by producers.

378854,Facilitating agroforestation of landscapes for sustainable benefits: Tradeoffs between carbon stocks and local development benefits in Indonesia according to the FALLOW model,"Although Indonesia has no shortage of land area that lost its forest cover before 1990 and has become the global leader in land-use based greenhouse gas emissions, the widespread expectation that the afforestation/reforestation approach to Clean Development Mechanisms (A/R CDM) could lead to sustainable development benefits has not so far materialized. The main challenges to implementation,of the current A/R CDM mechanisms are in ( I) the definition of forest and its institutional implications, (2) the projectization that is embedded in the definition of CDM, (3) non-linear baselines related to forest transitions that complicate attribution, (4) inherent lack of synergy with other development activities and (5) high transaction costs and temporary nature of credits. In possible new international regimes that aim to include all relevant changes in land-use based emissions, a more outcome-based programmatic approach may partially replace the project cycle assessments of CDM, However, there will still be a need to assess the combination of factors and policies that can be expected to enhance terrestrial carbon storage through voluntary land-use decisions, by a combination of reduced emissions and enhanced storage. Tradeoffs usually exist between local livelihoods and carbon storage, but assessment of the opportunity costs of C sequestration requires analysis at the landscape and community scale at scenario level, including local adjustment and optimization, We explored such scenarios for a number of cases in Indonesia that range from a forest margin to a degraded lands setting. FALLOW model applications were set up for 4 landscapes in Indonesia (15-98% forest cover, 1-55% grassland, 17-51 persons km(-2)) to test the internal consistency of the hypothesis that farmer-led development of tree-based land-use systems in response to accessible markets, legal tenure arrangements, availability of reliable technical information and local investment can convert degraded forest lands at low public cost and form an attractive alternative to project-based interventions with detailed prescriptions and planning. The calculated (non-linear) baselines for carbon stocks varied from an average trend of -0.26 to +0.23 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1) over a 25 year period of assessment, equivalent to a net sequestration of -0.95 to 0.84 t CO2 ha(-1) year(-1) The highest value for predicted additional carbon storage in the wider landscape did not coincide with the best results for local livelihoods, but in each of the case studies the results for a 'programmatic' removal of constraints to profitable smallholder tree-based production systems was more attractive than a 'prescribed' tree planting in designated project areas.

436315,Additionality When REDD Contracts Must be Self-Enforcing,"This paper examines self-enforcing contracts as a financial mechanism for reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation when the opportunity cost of the land (i.e., landholder type) is private information and is imperfectly correlated over time (i.e., partially persistent types). Because self-enforcement limits the feasible incentives, the conservation levels are constrained by the surplus created. Regardless of the degree of persistence of such opportunity costs across contracting periods, a first-best self-enforcing contract can deliver “additional” carbon sequestration beyond the business as usual scenario only if the value of forest conservation is sufficiently high. Otherwise, self-enforcing contracts can induce some, suboptimal level of carbon sequestration. The degree of persistence of opportunity costs across periods does not affect the amount of total payments provided in the optimal menu of contracts, but greater persistence of opportunity cost types leads to contracts that feature more of the total payment as a bonus in contracts for landholders with a high opportunity cost for their land and more of the total payment as an upfront fixed payment for landholders with a low opportunity cost. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Contracts; Development; Institutions; REDD; Self-enforcement; Climate change; Conservation; Contracts; Costs; Deforestation; Societies and institutions; Carbon sequestration; Development; Forest conservation; Forest degradation; Opportunity costs; Private information; REDD; Self-enforcement; Forestry; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation management; cost analysis; deforestation; development strategy; emission control; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental policy; forest management; incentive; institutional framework; land management; law enforcement,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5577700138092041,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Expert opinions about the EP of each technology varied substantially. Measuring EP in terms of the fractional decrease in output per unit input, we found that a scenario of worldwide carbon pricing leads to a decrease in the mean energy penalty of 1-10% across the technologies, and a scenario of increased US government research and development (R&D) funding leads to a decrease in the mean energy penalty of 6-14%. EP for pre-combustion capture showed the smallest improvement from R&D and carbon pricing, while EP for post-combustion capture with membranes or ""other"" approaches showed the largest improvement. Although other factors will also affect costs, EP is a large component and these results suggest that capture costs are likely to fall both through investments in research and through the process of commercializing the technology in response to carbon prices. We summarize the challenges for each technology that were described by the experts, as well as the quantitative results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The IPCC reports gives CCS a significant role in keeping global warming somewhere between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius, but still there is very few installations in operations and very few in the pipeline. This raises the question of why the diffusion of CCS has been slow and seem to slow down rather than speed up. First the paper discusses the question: When there is consensus the take-off of CCS depends on a high CO2 price, why is the price so low? Secondly discusses: What would happen if the CO2 price was 100 USD or higher? Would CCS then be the preferred way to reduce emissions or would other technologies be not only cheaper, but also faster and easier to implement? The paper concludes that the question the role of CCS in mitigating climate change also must be formulated as political problem, where the political/electoral effects of a high CO2 price plays a key role and needs to be taken much more explicitly into consideration than has been done so far.

We summarize the multifaceted decision-making process needed and offer guidelines to increase the success of the proposed ambitious efforts to increase tree cover world-wide. Given the varied definitions of and motivations for tree planting, it is critical that stakeholders work together to clearly define the biophysical and socioeconomic goals of each project.

Key guidelines to successfully increase tree cover include: (a) first addressing the underlying drivers of deforestation; (b) integrating decision-making across scales from local to global; (c) tailoring tree planting strategies to clearly stated project goals and planning, adaptively managing and evaluating success over a sufficiently long timeframe; (d) focusing on the forest ecosystem as a whole, and not just the trees; (e) coordinating different land uses and (f) involving stakeholders at all stages of the planning process. Synthesis and applications. Tree planting, along with other strategies to increase tree cover in appropriate locations and contexts, can make a valuable contribution to ensuring the ecological and social well-being of our planet in coming decades, but only if these efforts are considered as one component of multifaceted solutions to complex environmental problems and are carefully planned, implemented and monitored over a sufficiently long time-scale with stakeholder engagement and broader consideration of socio-ecological complexities.",afforestation; carbon stock; climate change mitigation; ecosystem services; forest landscape restoration; forest restoration; forestry; reforestation,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5543357133865356,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Various technical and non-technical (economic and social) challenges that currently prevent clean coal technologies and carbon capture and storage from being a widely used commercial technology are discussed and the goals for each research pathway are defined. The process of creating the roadmap started with a review and assessment of the existing national and international technology roadmaps, which represent a global picture of the state of the art and national and international plans fur the future on clean coal technologies and carbon capture and storage research development, demonstration, and deployment. Following this step, the national situation, capacities, and priorities were examined. Finally, research development, demonstration, and deployment actions discussed in the existing roadmaps and/or new actions were carefully selected and suggested as a draft Turkish Clean Coal Technologies and Carbon Capture and Storage Roadmap that needs further development and discussion by the input of interdisciplinary national stakeholders.

However, there is a need to assess the costs and effectiveness of such voluntary schemes. In particular there is a need for PES schemes to enhance climate regulating services in agricultural systems. In this paper we combine a choice experiment with a marginal abatement cost approach to determine the heterogeneity in cost-effectiveness of sequestration policy schemes in the UK farming sector. The results in general suggest that farmers show an aversion to drastic changes in land management activities but they can be encouraged to adopt relatively less restrictive activities through appropriate compensations. The results indicate that agricultural schemes can deliver carbon abatement at costs comparable to the official UK carbon price. This suggests that carbon sequestration in soils through land use changes and alternative land use management should be considered in UK policy developments to achieve carbon mitigation targets.

4372712,"Dynamic Stability of Soil Carbon: Reassessing the ""Permanence"" of Soil Carbon Sequestration","Enhancing soil organic matter in agricultural soils has potential to contribute to climate mitigation while also promoting soil health and resilience. However, soil carbon (C) sequestration projects are rare in C markets. One concern surrounding soil C is uncertainty regarding the permanence of newly sequestered soil C. This scientific uncertainty is exacerbated by differences in terminology used by scientists and policymakers, which impedes the integration of new scientific findings regarding soil carbon longevity into evidence-based policies. Here, we review the evolution of understanding of soil C lifespan and the language used to describe it in both scientific and policy sectors. We find that recent scientific findings that have bearing on soil C lifespan are not part of discussions surrounding C policy, and conversely, policymaker concerns are not clearly addressed by scientific research. From a policy perspective, soil C is generally assumed to be a vulnerable pool at risk of being quickly lost via microbial degradation or other avenues of physical loss if soil C building practices are not maintained indefinitely. This assumption has been challenged by recent scientific advances demonstrating that microbial consumption and transformation of plant-derived C actually necessary for the long-term storage of soil organic matter. Here, we argue that soil C longevity can best be understood as resulting from continual movement and transformation of organic compounds throughout the soil matrix, and show that this definition is directly at odds with how soil C longevity is represented in current policies. Given current interest in new policies to promote soil C sequestration activities, resolving these definitions is critical. We further identify priority areas for future research in order to answer key policymaker questions about soil C lifespan, and to help develop new tools and benchmarks necessary to assess efficacy of agricultural soil C sequestration efforts.",climate change; sustainable agriculture; soil carbon; carbon sequestration; microbial biomass,Review,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5507622361183167,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Meanwhile renewable energies are becoming more prevalent but are still a long way from being common place in many parts of the world. Under this circumstance, CCUS technologies could play a key role in abating CO2 emissions immediately. This study propose a concept of the carbon utilization technological paradigm (CUTP) which includes CUTP competition, CUTP diffusion and CUTP shift phases. This paper aims to apply technological paradigm theory to analyze the process of CUTP buildup, and to find out BECCS which is the future trajectory of carbon utilization technologies based on Web of Science, Note Express and Node Xl softwares. The regulatory framework in this paper provides scholars with new thoughts for their further studies. Our research also guide and accelerate development of carbon utilization technologies.

In this article a start has been made for the development of a sustainability, framework for carbon capture and storage (CCS) systems in the Netherlands. Using a participatory approach (which includes an exploratory workshop, two interactive meetings, an international survey and in-depth interviews), nine sustainability criteria for CCS based energy systems were defined and 36 main concerns about the sustainability of carbon, capture and storage systems (by criterion) were identified. Analysis shows that concerns related to the following criteria are most relevant: clean, flexible, just, competitive and publicly acceptable. Furthermore, via stakeholder consultations and through interviews, a list of actions to tackle the concerns was developed. These actions can be clustered into three groups: (i) increasing research and development, (ii) including CCS in a policy portfolio, and (iii) raising public awareness. Finally, actions that should take place in the next 2 years were identified. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, even those ""green"" tNETs may lead to undesirable side effects and thereby provoke moral concerns and conflicts. In this paper, I investigated whether BECCS, AR and EW would cause moral conflicts regarding the human right to adequate food if implemented on a scale sufficient to limit global warming ""to well below 2&thinsp;<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">ĝ</span>C"". Reviewing recent publications concerning BECCS, AR and EW, I found that EW would not conflict with the human right to adequate food but would likely even promote agricultural food production due to a higher nutrient provision. However, EW does not provide a feasible solution to limit global warming ""to well below 2&thinsp;<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">ĝ</span>C"", since a large-scale deployment of EW would require large investments and considerable amounts of energy to grind suitable rock-material. In regard of BECCS and AR, I found that even under the optimistic Representative Concentration Pathway 2.6 (RCP2.6), as assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its latest assessment report from 2013, a large-scale deployment of BECCS and/or AR would cause moral conflicts regarding the human right to adequate food for present and future generations. Due to this, I advocate for more and stronger mitigation efforts in line with efficient land management actions concerning, e.g. peats and soils, designated as ""natural climate solutions"" (NCS) and a deployment of multiple tNETs in near future.</p>. © 2019 BMJ Publishing Group.

5283119,Balancing a budget or running a deficit? The offset regime of carbon removal and solar geoengineering under a carbon budget,"The idea of the carbon budget is a powerful conceptual tool to define and quantify the climate challenge. Whilst scientists present the carbon budget as the geophysical foundation for global net-zero targets, the financial metaphor of a budget implies figuratively the existence of a 'budget manager' who oversees the budget balance. Using this fictive character of budget manager as a heuristic device, the paper analyses the roles of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and solar radiation management (SRM) under a carbon budget. We argue that both CDR and SRM can be understood as 'technologies of offset'. CDR offsets positive carbon emissions by negative emissions, whereas SRM offsets the warming from positive greenhouse gas forcing by the induced cooling from negative forcing. These offset technologies serve as flexible budgeting tools in two different strategies for budget management: they offer the promise of achieving a balanced budget, but also introduce the possibility for running a budget deficit. The lure of offsetting rests on the flexibility of keeping up an 'appearance' of delivering a given budget whilst at the same time easing budget constraints for a certain period of time. The political side-effect of offsetting is to change the stringency of budgetary constraints from being regulated by geophysics to being adjustable by human discretion. As a result, a budget deficit can be normalised as an acceptable fiscal condition. We suggest that the behavioural tendency of policymakers to avoid blame could lead them to resort to using offset technologies to circumvent the admission of failure to secure a given temperature target.",Carbon budget; Climate geoengineering; Carbon dioxide removal; Solar radiation management; Offset; Net zero,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5497319102287292,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

The Protocol formally establishing the Center was signed at ceremonies in Beijing by U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu, Chinese Minister of Science and Technology Wan Gang, and Chinese National Energy Agency Administrator Zhang Guobao. The CERC was designed to significantly improve the cooperation between the two countries in energy research and development in the areas of clean coal technology and carbon capture, sequestration and storage; clean vehicles; and building energy efficiency. In August, 2010, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced the selection of the Advanced Coal Technology Consortium (ACTC) led by West Virginia University as the U.S. participants in the CERC for coal related issues; the China team was announced later that fall and adopted the same name. Initial five year joint work plans for the U.S. and China participants in all three areas were signed on January 11, 2011 during President Hu Jintao's visit to the U.S. Since that time, the ACTC has made significant advances in developing new approaches to intellectual property (IP) management and collaborative research efforts. The research issues are broken into eight themes: Advanced Power Generation; Clean Coal Conversion Technology; Pre-Combustion CO2 Capture; Post-Combustion CO2 Capture; Oxy-Combustion Technology Development; CO2 Sequestration; CO2 Utilization with Microalgae; and Systems Integration, Simulation and Assessment. In addition, the ACTC has included significant activities related to IP management and development and a specific Communications and Integration task. Activities to date include some dominated by Chinese participants and some by the U.S. team. We are now seeing increasing activity in areas of mutual interest that are truly collaborative. The longterm value of the CERC and the opportunity for mutual benefit will depend largely on the value of the collaborative activities now underway. This paper provides an overview of the program from the beginning through the midpoint of the initial five year project plan. It also provides an overall assessment of the program as well as a perspective from the leadership of both the China and U.S. consortia. The CERC has broken new ground in research relationships between the two countries; this presentation will lay these out and provide an opportunity for discussion of the path ahead.

Renewable energy technologies can be perceived as hazardous and undesirable, much to the surprise of some. Siting failures can be high and unexpected. Broad, general support for renewable energy can give way to more polarization about specific proposals. While a growing literature exists about the formation of public support and opposition to wind and other renewable energy technologies, lessons relevant to the wind industry can be found from past experiences relating to hazardous technologies, including chemical processing plants, nuclear waste facilities, nuclear power plants, incinerators, and hazardous and municipal landfills, and locally unwanted land uses, such as airports, transmission lines, schools, and housing developments. There has been little direct application of this broad source of knowledge to wind or other renewable energy siting literature.

Three policy approaches that encompass the existing theories and policy, options are initially outlined: measures based on individuals social responsibility, government regulations, and carbon pricing. Evidence suggests that each of these options has little chance of being agreed upon and implemented at a global level. The economics of adaptation begins with climate signals which force individuals to adapt. Private adaptations are simultaneously tapped into for carbon dioxide removal and abatement. With increasingly severe damage over time, public sectors will be compelled to work in partnership with individuals and communities. Responding to amplifying climate signals, adaptation strategies evolve M such a way as to accelerate carbon dioxide reductions through low-carbon energy sources and technological solutions. Adaptations in a centuries-long timescale would effectively fend off dangerous global warming, but in a manner that is unbearably slow for the world's communities.

A number of approaches have been suggested, but the community appears to be silent on the potential of one of the most revolutionary technologies of the current century, systems and synthetic biology (SSB). The potential of SSB to modulate the fast carbon cycle, and thereby mitigate climate change is in itself enormous, but if the history of genomics is any measure, it is also reasonable to expect sizeable economic returns on any investment.

574876,Turning black swans green: The vittorio santaniello memorial lecture,"This article argues that the severe (or Black Swan) event of a financial crisis provides the opportunity to address other threatening issues-energy insecurity and climate change with the associated extreme weather events. The financial crisis has been catalytic in reassessing risk and the likelihood of extreme events-whether in finance or energy or climate. Already, a large part of expenditures from the global stimulus has been directed to diversifying the energy base of economies toward less carbon-intensive energy. Public expenditures, in an attempt to compensate for the fall in consumer spending, are stimulating a reformation of the capital and energy infrastructure of nations toward a lower carbon path of growth. Likewise, and consistent with this reassessment and transformation in energy, are the efforts to combat climate change and the prospects of extreme weather events. International negotiations and domestic legislation for cap and trade are moving towards providing more market-based incentives for this diversification of energy and at the same time stimulating lower-cost solutions for reducing carbon emissions. In both energy and climate, it is increasingly recognized that the economies of the world need to move to even greener technologies, which offer zero or even negative emissions. The 50-80% reduction in carbon emissions by 2050 currently called for by scientists can only be achieved through using energy-rich crops as a major source of fuels. Biofuels and biomass offer near zero emissions and when combined with carbon capture and sequestration could result even in negative emissions-providing energy while capturing carbon from the atmosphere. But advances in biotechnology are needed to reengineer plants to become more fuel rich and have lower cost in harvesting and processing if these ambitious reductions in carbon emissions are to be attained by mid-century. © 2010 AgBioForum.",,Article,2010.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5455633401870728,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

This paper Summarizes the experts' opinions and draws conclusions about four crucial aspects that influence CO2 capture and storage (CCS) deployment in China: technology research and experience accumulation, finance support, market development and policy and system. According to interviews result, technological improvement is necessary to cut down on CO2 capture cost and decrease technological uncertainty. Then, to make some rational policies and systems, with elements such as a carbon tax and clean electricity pricing, to drive power plants to adopt CO2 capture technology. Furthermore, financial incentive in both the long term and the short term, such as subsidies and CDM, will be important for CCS incentives, encouraging enterprises' enthusiasm for CCS and their capacity to enact it. Lastly, CCS deployment should be conducted under a market-oriented framework in the long term, so a business model and niche market deployment should be considered in advance. Among these aspects, policy and system is more complex than other three aspects, to resolve this obstacle, the innovation on electricity market and government decision model for climate change is crucial.

639674,Voice in Political Decision-Making: The Effect of Group Voice on Perceived Trustworthiness of Decision Makers and Subsequent Acceptance of Decisions,"The implementation of carbon dioxide capture and storage technology (CCS) is considered an important climate change mitigation strategy, but the viability of this technology will depend on public acceptance of CCS policy decisions. The results of three experiments with students as participants show that whether or not interest groups receive an opportunity to express their opinions in the decision-making process (i.e., group voice) affects acceptance of CCS policy decisions, with inferred trustworthiness of the decision maker mediating this effect. Decision-making procedures providing different interest groups with equal opportunities to voice their opinions instigate more trust in the decision maker and, in turn, lead to greater willingness to accept decisions compared to no-voice procedures (i.e.. unilateral decision-making Study I) and unequal group-voice procedures when one type of interest group receives voice, but another type of interest group does not Study 2). Study 3 further shows that an individual's own level of knowledge about CCS moderates the desire for an opportunity for members of the general public to voice opinions in the decision-making process, inferred trustworthiness of decision makers, and policy acceptance. These results imply that people care about voice in decision-making even when they are not directly personally involved in the decision-making process. We conclude that people tend to use procedural information when deciding to accept or oppose policy decisions on political complex issues: hence, it is important that policymakers use fair group-voice procedures and that they communicate to the public how they arrive at their decisions.",political decision-making; procedural fairness; trustworthiness; group voice; carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technology,Article,2010.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.5433993339538574,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0

Previous studies on the social acceptance of CCS have tended to rely on case studies of pilot projects or surveys of decision makers and the general public. Here, we take a different approach, using real world data about the social acceptance of hydraulic fracturing technologies to glean lessons for future carbon storage efforts. Hydraulic fracturing has many of the same operations, risks, and social narratives as carbon storage, making it a valid comparison. We conduct a statistical analysis on the relationship between various state demographic and economic factors and the stringency of state regulations governing the hydraulic fracturing industry. As a complement to this analysis, we conduct a comparative case study on the development of hydraulic fracturing regulations in New York and Pennsylvania. We find robust statistical evidence that familiarity with the oil and gas industry is associated with a decrease in regulatory variance among states where hydraulic fracturing takes place. Moreover, we identify a tension between regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing at the state level and regulatory control at the local level. This dynamic suggests that carbon storage policymakers and industrial leaders should emphasize local engagement in addition to state-level participation. © 2014 The Authors.

292399,Splitting rock vs. splitting atoms: What shale gas means for nuclear power,"The past decade has seen a sudden surge in shale gas production in the United States, and a dramatic drop in natural gas prices. The shale gas boom has major implications for the future of nuclear power, the author writes. Projections for the cost of electricity suggest that natural gas will maintain an advantage over nuclear power for many years to come in the United States, and there is reason to believe that overseas markets could eventually enjoy some of the benefits of the shale gas boom. Uncertainties about the size of shale resources and the long-term productivity of new wells could affect the future price of natural gas in the United States but are unlikely to make nuclear power competitive with gas, the author argues. However, public fears about environmental contamination could drive up the cost of natural gas. The author urges companies and policy makers to address these fears in ways that build public confidence. Stringent climate policy probably would not eliminate the cost advantage of natural gas over nuclear before 2030, he writes, but could tip the balance after that. The biggest question mark looming over natural gas in a carbon-constrained world is the prospect of applying carbon-capture-and-sequestration technology to the resource.",carbon capture and sequestration; climate change; coal; energy prices; natural gas; nuclear power; shale gas,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5422576665878296,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
725505,Zero emission targets as long-term global goals for climate protection,"Recently, assessments have robustly linked stabilization of global-mean temperature rise to the necessity of limiting the total amount of emitted carbon-dioxide (CO2). Halting global warming thus requires virtually zero annual CO2 emissions at some point. Policymakers have now incorporated this concept in the negotiating text for a new global climate agreement, but confusion remains about concepts like carbon neutrality, climate neutrality, full decarbonization, and net zero carbon or net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here we clarify these concepts, discuss their appropriateness to serve as a long-term global benchmark for achieving temperature targets, and provide a detailed quantification. We find that with current pledges and for a likely (>66%) chance of staying below 2 degrees C, the scenario literature suggests net zero CO2 emissions between 2060 and 2070, with net negative CO2 emissions thereafter. Because of residual non-CO2 emissions, net zero is always reached later for total GHG emissions than for CO2. Net zero emissions targets are a useful focal point for policy, linking a global temperature target and socio-economic pathways to a necessary long-term limit on cumulative CO2 emissions.",climate policy; climate stabilization; UNFCCC; greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; global goal; climate change,Article,2015.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5412498712539673,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
581204,Adaptation to Global Warming as an Optimal Transition Process to A Greenhouse World,"This article develops the economics of adaptation to global warming as an optimal transition process to future climates. Three policy approaches that encompass the existing theories and policy options are initially outlined: measures based on individuals' social responsibility, government regulations, and carbon pricing. Evidence suggests that each of these options has little chance of being agreed upon and implemented at a global level. The economics of adaptation begins with climate signals which force individuals to adapt. Private adaptations are simultaneously tapped into for carbon dioxide removal and abatement. With increasingly severe damage over time, public sectors will be compelled to work in partnership with individuals and communities. Responding to amplifying climate signals, adaptation strategies evolve in such a way as to accelerate carbon dioxide reductions through low-carbon energy sources and technological solutions. Adaptations in a centuries-long timescale would effectively fend off dangerous global warming, but in a manner that is unbearably slow for the world's communities. The optimality of the transition process is based on micro efficiency, coordination, and the public goods nature and unique characteristics of specific adaptation strategies. © 2015 Institute of Economic Affairs.",,Article,2015.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5412365794181824,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
673109,Directed technical change and the adoption of CO2 abatement technology: The case of CO2 capture and storage,"This paper studies the cost-effectiveness of combining traditional environmental policy, such as CO2-trading schemes, and technology policy that has aims of reducing the cost and speeding the adoption of CO2 abatement technology. For this purpose, we develop a dynamic general equilibrium model that captures empirical links between CO2 emissions associated with energy use, directed technical change and the economy. We Specify CO2 capture and storage (CCS) as a discrete CO2 abatement technology. We find that combining CO2-trading schemes with an adoption subsidy is the most effective instrument to induce adoption of the CCS technology. Such a subsidy directly improves the competitiveness of the CCS technology by compensating for its markup over the cost of conventional electricity. Yet, introducing R&D subsidies throughout the entire economy leads to faster adoption of the CCS technology as well and in addition can be cost-effective in achieving the abatement target.

5304104,"Integrating ecological, social and policy aspects to develop peatland restoration strategies in orang kayo hitam forest park, jambi, indonesia","Wulandari C, Novriyanti N, Iswandaru D. 2021. Integrating ecological, social and policy aspects to develop peatland restoration strategies in Orang Kayo Hitam Forest Park, Jambi, Indonesia. Biodiversitas 22: 4158-4168. Peatlands play an essential role in delivering various ecosystem services, yet in many areas in Indonesia, peat forests have been deforested, degraded, and threatened by repeated fires. As such, restoration efforts need to be done. But these require various considerations, including ecological aspects such as type degradation conditions, water table, species selected for planting, and climates, socio-economic aspects like community's involvement, and policy aspects such as regulations and institutions at national and local levels. This study aimed to analyze peatland restoration strategies in Orang Kayo Hitam (OKH) Forest Park, Jambi using the Strengths, Weaknesses, Threats, and Opportunities (SWOT) framework. The analysis was done by integrating multiple aspects such as policy, biodiversity conservation, and surrounding community participation. Data were collected using virtual ethnographic techniques due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Key informants (i.e., OKH Forest Park Unit area managers, NGOs, staff of national government, and university academics) and selected respondents were interviewed to identify and determine factors considered as internal (i.e., Strengths and Weaknesses) and external (i.e., Threats and Opportunities). This qualitative data was then analyzed using a SWOT approach through the IFE (Internal Factor Evaluation) and EFE (External Factor Evaluation) Matrix. The research findings showed that from 12 internal factors and 11 external factors, efforts to restore peatland ecosystems in Orang Kayo Hitam (OKH) Forest Park had obtained very strong values in the biodiversity aspect. The SWOT matrix analysis showed values of S-W = 0.43 and O-T = 0.16 positioned in quadrant I. This result suggests that the most powerful strategies can be developed aggressively from the factors of strengths and opportunities. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

558837,Climate geoengineering: Solar radiation management and its implications for intergenerational equity,"Introduction. As David Victor recently observed, climate geoengineering, broadly defined as “the deliberate large-scale manipulation of the planetary environment to counteract anthropogenic climate change,” was once viewed as “a freak show in otherwise serious discussions of climate science and policy.” However, in the past few years, the feckless response of the world community to burgeoning greenhouse gas emissionshas led to increasingly serious consideration of geoengineering as a potential means to avoid a “climate emergency,” such as rapid melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets, or as a stopgap measure to buy time for effective emissions mitigation responses. Indeed, a number of recent studies indicate that geoengineering schemes could potentially mitigate the climatic impacts associated with a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from preindustrial levels. However, many policy makers and commentators, even including some who have signaled tentative support for geoengineering options, have expressed serious reservations. Most of the focus of these concerns has been on intragenerational considerations associated with the two major categories of geoengineering, solar radiation management (SRM) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) schemes. For example, several recent studies have concluded that stratospheric sulfate aerosol injection, perhaps the most widely discussed SRM scheme, could lead to a substantial reduction in precipitation in monsoon regions in East and South-East Asia and Africa. This could result in a severe reduction in monsoonal intensity, potentially undermining the food security of 2 billion people in the region. Diebacks of tropics forests could also be triggered by substantial precipitation declines in the Amazon and Congo valleys. Additionally, sulfate aerosol loading of the atmosphere could accelerate the hydroxyl-catalyzed ozone depstructure cycles, resulting in significant depletion of the stratospheric ozone layer. For example, a recent study concluded that sulfate aerosol loading could result in an annual 4.5 percent decrease in stratospheric ozone levels, more than the annual mean global total loss due to the emission of anthropogenic ozone depleting substances in recent years. Several studies have also indicated that ocean iron fertilization, a CDR approach, could undermine biological productivity in non-fertilized regions, cause widespread eutrophication and anoxia, and stimulate toxic algal blooms. © Cambridge University Press 2013.",,Book Chapter,2010.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5386013388633728,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
590961,Importance of programme design for potential US domestic GHG offset supply and quality,"Greenhouse gas (GHG) offsets are a central feature of most regional and national cap-and-trade systems. A greenhouse offset credit represents a tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) reduced, avoided or sequestered by a project implemented specifically to compensate for emissions occurring elsewhere. Several existing modelling studies estimate the technically and economically achievable supply of GHG offsets from uncapped sources in the US. This analysis is among the few that consider how the design of offset protocols - and the corresponding rules for eligibility, measuring, verifying and awarding offsets - might impact actual offset crediting and the realization of GHG mitigation potential. The presented analysis demonstrates how rules for each of these factors could impact the supply of offset credits, as well as the emissions-reduction benefits of an offset programme. Findings indicate that although lenient offset rules and protocols may bring several times more credits to market than a conservative approach, these gains in offset supply would come at a significant cost to the effectiveness of the cap-and-trade system in achieving its central purpose: reducing overall GHG emissions. In particular, lenient rules and protocols could conceivably lead US emissions to exceed legislative targets by as much as 500 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2020.",cap-and-trade; climate legislation; emissions trading; greenhouse gas offsets; USA,Article,2011.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5383735299110413,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
5343985,Knowledge systems approaches for enhancing project impacts in complex settings: community fire management and peatland restoration in Indonesia,"Knowledge systems approaches for enhancing the impact of research are well established and tend to focus on the ways in which researchers can adapt their engagement with stakeholders to achieve a better “fit” between research and action agendas. Yet, these approaches are often based on explicit or implicit assumptions of a skilled and willing research team, and stable and well-defined stakeholders, who have consistent and reasonably well-defined needs. This paper discusses how knowledge systems approaches were developed and deployed in the first phase of the Gambut Kita (Our Peatland) project on community fire management and peatland restoration in Indonesia (2017–2021). This was a complex project with a large multi-disciplinary team situated across dynamic institutions in Indonesia and Australia, and addressing a politically controversial topic. To capture the diverse experience of the researchers, and to focus on the needs of stakeholders, we developed a sequence of whole-of-project approaches comprising the following: (i) stakeholder mapping exercises at three nested scales combining stakeholder analysis, knowledge systems mapping and impact pathways analysis; (ii) a project coordinating committee of high-level Indonesian policy-makers and policy-influencers; (iii) a stakeholder engagement forum and (iv) online policy dialogues. We demonstrate its effects through the case of developing an Indonesian Peat Fire Danger Rating System (Peat FDRS), as a core project deliverable. Over 4 years, these structured stakeholder engagement processes gave rise to a Peat FDRS Stakeholder Engagement Network (a multi-institutional working group), which is making significant progress in navigating the complexity inherent in realising an accurate Indonesian Peat FDRS. © 2022, The Author(s).",,Article,2022.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.5376896858215332,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
2479421,Higher Carbon Prices on Emissions Alone Will Not Deliver the Paris Agreement,"Limiting global warming to 2 degrees C by 2100 requires anthropogenic CO2 emissions to reach zero by 2070 and become negative afterwards; therefore, large-scale carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from the atmosphere is critical. We investigate the effectiveness of carbon prices in achieving the deep decarbonization needed in the power system. We find that if only CO2 emitters are penalized, increasing prices to the social cost of carbon is sufficient to achieve a decarbonized system in the medium-term but not maintain it in the long-term. Unless carbon pricing mechanisms are adapted to remunerate CDR services, CDR technologies are not deployed. Incentivizing CDR could mean that lower levels of carbon taxation are needed to meet the Paris Agreement, which in turn lowers electricity costs. However, the deployment of CDR technologies could prolong the use of unabated fossil fuels in a carbon-constrained system, therefore, disincentives must be implemented to prevent this moral hazard from manifesting.",,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5366770029067993,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
407091,Social Acceptance and Optimal Pollution: CCS or Tax?,"The two main hurdles to a widespread carbon capture and storage (CCS) deployment are its cost and social acceptance issues. Assessing accurately social preferences is thus interesting to determine whether CCS techniques use is socially optimal. Unlike most academic papers that have a dichotomous approach and consider either the atmospheric pollution (first source of marginal disutility) or the underground pollution (second source), the problem is considered as a whole: CCS introduces a third source of disutility due to the simultaneous presence of CO2 in the atmosphere and in geological formations. We show that there are some configurations of social preferences for which CCS use grants a higher social welfare provided that public authorities tax the carbon content of fossil fuels and subsidise carbon storage. CCS can even increase simultaneously the social welfare of the country with CCS and the one of the country without. Tied with the idea of minimising the decarbonizing costs and with the large literature on burden sharing in greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, two cases are compared to assess the transfers required to encourage CCS deployment: the case where each country defines its own climate policy and when they are aggregated.",Carbon capture and storage; Pollution; Tax; Social acceptance; Social optimum,Article,2015.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5362890362739563,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Many post-Kyoto frameworks have been debated, but surprisingly approaches that focus on consumption have received little attention in the climate change literature despite broader interest in other areas. In this article we extend the argument for constructing GHG inventories using a country's consumption rather than production. First, we argue that constructing GHG inventories using a country's economic activity instead of geographic territory solves allocation issues for international activities such as international transportation and carbon capture and storage. Second, we argue that consumption-based GHG inventories have many advantages over production-based inventories. The main advantages are to address carbon leakage, reduce the importance of emission commitments for developing countries, increase options for mitigation, encourage environmental comparative advantage, address competitiveness concerns, and naturally encourage technology diffusion.",,Article,2008.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5336009860038757,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

One of NETL's main initiatives to promote information and knowledge sharing is the development of a series of BPMs that outline uniform approaches to address a variety of CCUS-related issues and challenges. A major online resource developed by DOE is the National Carbon Sequestration Database and Geographic Information System (NATCARB). which is a geographic information system (GIS)-based tool developed to provide an interactive visual representation of CCUS potential.

305701,The impact of carbon capture and storage on overall mitigation policy,"Policy makers, as well as many economists, recognize geological carbon capture and storage (CCS) as an option for avoiding costly emission reductions. While an extreme perspective is to envision CCS as a magic bullet to solve the issue of climate change, a more balanced economics perspective would situate this approach within a portfolio of mitigation actions. CCS can be implemented with two purposes: it can act as a substitute for other technological efforts to reach a given environmental target and it offers the potential for additional emission reductions to reach a 'safer' climate target. In order to balance these two possible ways of utilizing CCS and to assess their respective effects on early policy strategies, we have undertaken a twofold numerical experiment. First, a cost-efficiency analysis was undertaken, where the sole effect of CCS was substitution for other efforts. This was followed by a cost-benefit analysis where both purposes had to be balanced. We find that future availability of CCS is less of a reason to relax near-term abatement efforts than what could be inferred from previous analyses. Moreover, the cost-benefit analysis indicates that environmental targets should be more ambitious when CCS is included in the picture.",climate change; uncertainty; storage; cost-benefit analysis; policy options; environmental targets,Article,2007.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5317110419273376,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

The magnitude of the global benefits for biodiversity from this mechanism will be significantly enhanced if the credit trading system includes forest regeneration and protection in developing countries and the carbon benefits of management practices that lead to increased storage of carbon in agricultural soils. While the impediments to including these two groups of activities, such as measurement difficulties, need further work to be resolved, they are not qualitatively different from the challenges present in all aspects of monitoring environmental protection programs.

5336641,Social science for the next decade of carbon capture and storage,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been an object of social science research for nearly two decades now. However, CCS has moved beyond coal-fired electricity, and its roles in industrial decarbonization and atmospheric carbon dioxide removal are newly valued. Is the earlier social science research on CCS applicable to the current moment, or has the context and the object of inquiry changed? This paper assesses whether existing findings are fit-for-purpose, arguing that there are some useful insights, but they have not been applied well to CCS policy and development. The early period of social science research also faces topical and methodological limitations. The paper identifies four areas for social science research for this decade of broader CCS applications — researching CCS in the context of decarbonization, tradeoffs, and a just transition; shifting the focus from “whether” to “how” questions around deployment, including benefits and environmental justice dimensions; exploring new approaches to public engagement globally; and researching how understandings of CCS evolve within the current social media and information landscape. © 2021",,Article,2021.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.5291362404823303,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The initiative, known as the Carbon Farming Initiative, represents a significant investment as part of the government's climate change and land-use policies. To examine the potential opportunities and constraints faced by Australia's grain farms to engage in these carbon farming activities, we interviewed 31 grain farmers and five industry professionals. Our analysis suggests that a lack of project methodology development and the current project approval processes pose significant constraints to engagement. A particular concern for farmers is the extent of the permanence obligation requiring long-term maintenance of the carbon possibly more than 100 years and the additionality requirement regarding the common practice test that if too many others are doing the practice it will not get the required for project approval. Given the requirements of the processes and the associated transaction costs, producing offsets from dryland grain cropping operations in Australia is currently not a profitable endeavour for farmers and therefore fails to act as an incentive to participation.",Soil carbon; emissions reduction; agricultural policy; additionality; permanence; market-based instrument,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5276681184768677,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Sustainable mangrove management (SMM) aims to address mangrove degradation and reverse trends of mangrove loss while empowering local stakeholders to participate in governance processes. This paper contributes to SMM scholarship through a case study of Punta Galeta, a protected mangrove forest located in the Colón District in Panama, near the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal. Our primary objective was to understand the challenges and opportunities associated with SMM in Punta Galeta and to identify insights of relevance to Panama and Latin America. We identified several successful SMM strategies, such as local awareness-raising on the socio-ecological benefits of mangrove forests and corporate sponsorship of mangrove restoration. However, several facets of SMM remained challenging, such as implementing and enforcing management plans and fostering regular communication and collaboration between all stakeholders. Findings suggest that local-level SMM requires a greater focus on strategies to enhance communication, collaboration, and trusting relationships between diverse stakeholders, as well as a more cohesive vision for the sectoral uses of coastlines. Further experimentation with different forms of social organization in support of local sustainable mangrove forest conservation and management are needed. © 2022",,Article,2022.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.5239380598068237,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Most of the literature, however, focuses Oil assessing the capacity of existing technology to sequester carbon in soils. There is much less discussion in the literature oil the social and institutional elements that need to be in place to realize the potential benefits of carbon sequestration. This paper contributes Insights in this direction by analyzing it case of community-based pasture management in north-central Mali. The case study challenges common assumptions in carbon sequestration efforts, namely that land resources are devoted to it single use by resident users; have distinct boundaries and fall within identifiable territorial and administrative jurisdictions, and are subject to widely recognized claims and free of conflict. We suggest that this is not always the case. Findings indicate that carbon sequestration projects centered oil rangelands need to allow for flexibility in livestock movements and resource availability and to account for the diverging interest of multiple stakeholders, including different types of pastoralists and farmers. We conclude that social capital formation and conflict management are key elements of it carbon sequestration strategy in supports of sustainable and equitable development in the Sahelian region.

618132,What about coal? Interactions between climate policies and the global steam coal market until 2030,"Because of economic growth and a strong increase in global energy demand the demand for fossil fuels and therefore also greenhouse gas emissions are increasing, although climate policy should lead to the opposite effect. The coal market is of special relevance as coal is available in many countries and often the first choice to meet energy demand. In this paper we assess possible interactions between climate policies and the global steam coal market. Possible market adjustments between demand regions through market effects are investigated with a numerical model of the global steam coal market: the ""COALMOD-World"" model. This equilibrium model computes future trade flows, infrastructure investments and prices until 2030. We investigate three specific designs of climate policy: a unilateral European climate policy, an Indonesian export-limiting policy and a fast-roll out of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in the broader context of climate policy and market constraints. We find that market adjustment effects in the coal market can have significant positive and negative impacts on the effectiveness of climate policies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The IBDP Communication Plan includes consortium information, funding and disclaimer citations, description of target audiences, media communications guidelines, paper and presentations guidelines, site visit information, crisis communication, on-site photography regulations, and other components. The creation, development, and implementation processes for the IBDP Communication Plan (the Plan) are shared in this paper. New communications challenges, such as how to address add-on research requests, data sharing and management, scope increase, and contract agreements have arisen since the Plan was completed in January 2009, resulting in development of new policies and procedures by project management. Integrating communications planning, risk assessment, and project management ensured that consistent, factual information was developed and incorporated into project planning, and constitutes the basis of public communications. Successful integration has allowed the IBDP to benefit from early identification and mitigation of the potential project risks, which allows more time to effectively deal with unknown and unidentified risks that may arise. Project risks and risks associated with public perception can be managed through careful planning and integration of communication strategies into project management and risk mitigation.

Here we present a technology roadmap for CCS, depicted in terms of external factors and short- and long-term pathways for its development, moving from a demonstration to commercialisation era. The roadmap was been developed through a two-phase process of stakeholder engagement; the second phase of this, a high level stakeholder workshop, is documented here. This approach has provided a unique overview of the current status, potential and barriers to CCS deployment in the UK. In addition to the roadmap graphics and more detailed review, five consensus conclusions emerging from the workshop are presented. These describe the need for a monetary CO(2) value and the financing of carbon capture and storage schemes; the lack of technical barriers to the deployment of demonstration scale CCS plant; the role of demonstration projects in developing a robust regulatory framework; key storage issues; the need for a long-term vision in furthering both the technical and non-technical development of CCS.

5343719,The science and sociology of restoring asia’s tropical forest ecosystems,"Thirty years ago, reforestation in the tropics meant planting monocultures of economic trees. Ecosystem restoration was rarely practised, due to lack of effective techniques. Since then, ecologists have devised ways to: I) assist natural forest regeneration (ANR), ii) plant the right trees in the right places and iii) ameliorate soils on severely degraded sites. Such techniques can maximize recovery of i) biomass, ii) structural complexity, iii) biodiversity and iv) ecological functioning on sites at all stages of degradation. Forest restoration has now become a global priority, with the UN calling for restoration of 350 million hectares by 2030 (the Bonn Challenge). However most of the area pledged to the initiative will become monoculture plantations (45%) or agroforests (21%), even though ecological restoration sequesters 40 and 6 times more carbon respectively and supports far higher biodiversity. Whilst scientists have overcome the technical barriers to restoration, social “scientists” have yet to develop effective tools to overcome the socio-economic barriers, such as poor governance, inadequate stakeholder motivation and ineffective funding mechanisms and science-policy interface. Scientists have delivered the technical tools for restoration–now the social scientists, economists and politicians must deliver the socio-economic tools. © 2019, Thai Society of Higher Eduation Institutes on Environment.

261117,"Communicating soil carbon science to farmers: Incorporating credibility, salience and legitimacy","A key narrative within climate change science is that conserving and improving soil carbon through agricultural practices can contribute to agricultural productivity and is a promising option for mitigating carbon loss through sequestration. This paper examines the potential disconnect between science and practice in the context of communicating information about soil carbon management. It focuses on the information producing process and on stakeholder (adviser, farmer representative, policy maker etc) assessment of the attributes credibility, salience and legitimacy. In doing this it draws on results from consultations with stakeholders in the SmartSOIL project which aimed to provide decision support guidelines about practices that optimise carbon mitigation and crop productivity. An iterative methodology, used to engage stakeholders in developing, testing and validating a range of decision support guidelines in six case study regions across Europe, is described. This process enhanced legitimacy and revealed the importance, and the different dimensions, of stakeholder views on credibility and salience. The results also highlight the complexities and contested nature of managing soil carbon. Some insights are gained into how to achieve more effective communication about soil carbon management, including the need to provide opportunities in projects and research programmes for dialogue to engender better understanding between science and practice.

5260134,State Cost-Share Programs for Forest Landowners in the Southern United States: A Review,"The largest concentration of state-level forest cost-share programs in the United States can be found in the southern states. Since the inception of the first programs in the 1970s, the state-level forest cost-share programs in the US South have acted as models for the rest of the country. Cost-share programs compensate landowners through direct reimbursements to address barriers such as limited owner capital and cash flow in the initial years of investment. Through a review of the literature and progress reports from southern state forestry agencies, we qualitatively assessed state-level cost-share programs and their status in the southern states. We identified the common themes in the literature related to cost-share programs: market, nonmarket, and landowners' perceptions and knowledge. Many of the programs enacted between the 1970s and 1980s aimed to ensure a sustainable timber supply, a market good, from private forestlands. A few of the programs enacted more recently compensate landowners for nonmarket benefits such as forest health or soil and water conservation. Two of the nine available programs are practically inactive in recent years because of a lack of funding. We discuss current prospects regarding funding, partnerships, and broadening the focus of incentives to cover forest-based ecosystem services. Study Implications Regionally, cost-share programs in the US South differ in eligibility criteria, funding source and status, and resource management objectives. The majority of state-level cost-share programs in the US South were enacted 30 to 50 years ago. The first cost-share programs were designed to support a continued timber supply from private forestlands, but a few recent programs have expanded their objectives to protect forest health and soil and water quality. Forest-based ecosystem service markets, specifically reforestation to capture atmospheric carbon dioxide and provide clean air and water, have become more prevalent in recent years. Funding for forest commodity incentive programs is a continual challenge. New funding sources and new programs are crucial to meet demands for incentives for landowners to provide both timber and ecosystem services outputs.",forest landowners; reimbursement; cost-share programs; US South; ecosystem services,Review,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5198100209236145,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

An Australian case of carbon mitigation through carbon farming represents a discursive tool with which indigenous groups are seeking to leverage a very distinct conceptualization of payment for ecosystem services, one that values the labor and reciprocal relationships and logic of care required to abate or sequester carbon. Inscribed with an inalienable ancestral cultural signature, the indigenous produced carbon offsets being promoted by indigenous carbon market participants represent more than a mere carbon reduction; they initiate processes of potentially enduring exchange and engagement. This carbon signature works to enrich carbon as well as embed peoples' relations with it, with each other, and with the places from which the offset is generated. Contributing to emergent research into cultures of carbon, it is our conjecture that valorizing these relations in ethical exchanges is a potentially productive way of financing alternative approaches to environmental stewardship.

We used storytelling as a communication concept to analyse the narratives of five main certification standards that accompanied the implementation of REDD+ projects in Central Africa. Our analysis focuses on two storylines: the measurement of avoided deforestation, and payments or rewards. The examination of official documents disseminated by certification standards and the results from a survey of REDD+ stakeholders highlighted a gap between these promises and reality. Our findings show that carbon standards have diffused an idyllic view of REDD+, simplifying methods of measuring avoided deforestation and promising payments, co-benefits and sustainable development. Unkept promises result in disappointment and declining enthusiasm on the part of those involved in REDD+ projects at an early stage. © 2020 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

507101,In Brief: National Academies' report dissects prospects for US hydrogen economy,"A transition to hydrogen as a major fuel in the next 50 yr could significantly change the US's energy economy, but major technical, economic and infrastructure barriers need to be overcome, according to a new DOE-sponsored report from the National Academies' National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council. Meeting the aim of President Bush's hydrogen initiative, to make the use of hydrogen-powered vehicles practical and cost-effective by 2020, would require overcoming many hurdles. The report foresees a likely transition stage where hydrogen is produced on a small scale using natural gas or electricity, but this would require a sharp reduction in production costs for small units. The report points out that while natural gas would probably be the most cost-effective source of hydrogen, its long-term use for this purpose would not increase the nation's energy independence. The report also highlights the need to develop significantly cheaper and more reliable fuel cells, along with safer systems for transporting, storing, and handling hydrogen in a consumer setting.

An RS study, Geoengineering the climate: Science, governance and uncertainty, says unless future measures to cut greenhouse-gas emissions are much more successful than those taken so far, some little-tested forms of more radical intervention may be needed in the longer term. The most promising of these are Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) and Solar Radiation Management. CDR could take 3 main forms, i.e., capturing CO2 from the ambient air; enhanced weathering, which uses chemical reactions involved in rock weathering to reduce CO2 levels in the air; and increased afforestation to enable more CO2 to be absorbed by vegetation. However, the first two techniques have yet to be shown to be practical or cost effective, while afforestation would create land-use conflicts. The society also investigated ideas such as shields in space to deflect the sun's rays, but said they would be prohibitively expensive at the moment.

Although a sine qua non of successful mangrove rehabilitation or restoration projects is accurate attention to local hydrology and basic biology of mangrove trees and their associated fauna, their long-term success depends on far more axes, each with their own challenges. Rehabilitation projects: are planned, designed, executed, and managed by people with diverse backgrounds and different scientific and socio-political agendas; need to be responsive to these multiple stakeholders and agents who hold different values; are often influenced by laws and treaties spanning local to international scales; and must be able to adapt and evolve both geomorphologically and socioeconomically over decades-to-centuries in the context of a rapidly changing climate. We view these challenges as opportunities for innovative approaches to rehabilitation and restoration that engage new and larger constituencies. Restored mangrove ecosystems can be deliberately designed and engineered to provide valuable ecosystem services, be adaptable to climatic changes, and to develop platforms for educating nonspecialists about both the successes and failures of restored mangrove ecosystems. When mangrove rehabilitation or restoration projects are developed as experiments, they can be used as case-studies and more general models to inform policy- and decision-makers and guide future restoration efforts. Achieving this vision will require new investment and dedication to research and adaptive management practices.

The Department of Energy's mission is to promote the energy security of the United States in an economic and environmentally sound manner. We achieve this mission by supporting a broad and deep array of technology research that spans nuclear, renewables, and fossil fuels. As part of this mix, the Office of Fossil Energy and the National Energy Technology Laboratory are dedicated to advancing technologies that permit the continued use of coal, the most abundant domestic fossil resource in the United States. Improved technologies have been developed and deployed, enabling the use of coal in environmentally responsive ways. However, cleaner, more efficient, fossilfueled systems, capable of delivering both electric power and clean liquid fuels, while economically capturing and storing carbon dioxide (CO2), are required to address the challenges of a secure, affordable, and environmentally responsible energy future for the United States and the world. Our contributions include the research, development, and demonstration (RD&amp;D) of clean coal technologies that are highly efficient, achieve near-zero emissions (including CO2), and are commercially deployable in a competitive energy market. The Clean Coal Program's near-term focus is on removing technological obstacles and enabling economic compliance with existing and anticipated environmental regulations, increasing power generation efficiency for new and existing coalfueled plants, and developing innovative technologies capable of economically capturing CO2 from our existing fleet of coal-fired power plants. In the longer term, our aim is to nearly double energy plant efficiencies, generate coal-fueled electricity while achieving near-zero atmospheric emissions, including carbon capture and storage (CCS), and produce affordable liquid fuels from coal and biomass feedstocks. Ultimately, our aim is to preserve domestic coal as a viable and secure energy source for both primary baseload electricity generation and clean liquid-fuel production. The Clean Coal RD&amp;D Program being pursued by the United States is composed of the following integrated key technology areas: • Advanced power systems such as integrated gasification combined-cycle technologies, next-generation hydrogen turbines, and solid-oxide fuel cells targeted at lower cost, more efficient, near-zero emission energy systems. • Carbon Sequestration with a key goal of reducing capture and long-term storage costs to less than a 10 percent increase in cost of electricity for new systems. • Carbon capture and compression enabling long-term storage, and water use reduction innovations for existing systems. • Advanced liquid fuels for transportation from emerging Coal-Biomass-to- Liquids (CBTL) technologies. • Advanced, cross-cutting research in areas such as computation, modeling, and simulation; high-temperature materials; and reliable and highly automated instrumentation and control systems for advanced energy plants. • An aggressive FutureGen/Clean Coal Power Initiative program aimed at proving emerging technologies at large scale in order to facilitate their commercialization. With increasing recognition that natural gas and ethanol systems are not carbonfree, the President's Fiscal Year 2009 Clean Coal Technology budget request exceeds $600 million and includes increases in carbon capture and storage research and large-scale demonstration activities (important to all carbon-based energy systems) and incorporates CBTL fuel conversion technologies. Commercial deployment of clean coal technologies with CCS technology faces critical challenges including rising equipment, construction, and feedstock costs, as well as technology risk, financial liability, uncertain regulatory framework, and rising demand for skilled human resources. This paper will discuss state-of-the art coal technology, research performance goals, and plans for advanced clean coal technology development.",,Conference Paper,2008.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5145159363746643,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
568390,Ecological and economic impacts of forest policies: interactions across forestry and agriculture,"A linked model of the US forest and agriculture sectors was used to examine the economic and ecological impacts of two forest policies: a minimum harvest age limitation and a reduced public harvest policy. Simulated private responses to both policies indicate that landowners could undertake a range of adjustments to minimize their welfare impacts, but imposition of constraints on the management of existing timber stocks have particularly potent effects. Environmental changes associated with the responses include: (I) impacts on biodiversity trends and wildlife habitat conditions when economic incentives prompt afforestation of cropland in the North and less conversion of hardwood forest types to softwood plantations in the South; (2) age class distributions in all regions are 'shortened', compressing a larger inventory volume into fewer, younger age classes; (3) reductions in the area of the earliest forest successional stages, despite the concentration of inventory in the earlier ages, because of rising timber management intensity in some regions; and (4) sequestered carbon in all parts of the forest system may continue to rise even after total product volumes have begun to fall. Interregional economic impacts include higher prices for private forest land and timber products in the southern US, due to a reduced public harvest policy concentrated in the West.

1376122,Wetland restoration in Central Europe: aims and methods,". Wetlands have always been of particular significance for mankind. While originally attractive as hunting grounds, they were later cultivated and modified from sinks into sources. Today, great efforts are being made to restore disturbed or destroyed wetland areas. Different models and goals for wetland restoration exist. From a global point of view, reduction of climatically relevant trace gas emissions is relevant, especially in the case of fens. Regionally and locally, the creation of retention basins for water and compounds or the establishment of characteristic fen species and communities may have high priority. In order to avoid goal conflicts, nature development plans are required which consider not just the wetland to be restored, but the entire catchment area. Such plans should include spatially and temporally differentiated recommendations for implementation of restoration measures and a proper land use system. When it comes to defining concrete aims, the participation of local people should be encouraged. Rewetting and oligotrophication are the most common approaches to boost biodiversity in fen ecosystems in Central and Western Europe. Rewetting includes both quantitative and qualitative aspects, requiring quantitative hydrological models and chemical analyses of the groundwater in the region. In addition, re-introduction of species is often necessary, at least in heavily fragmented cultural landscapes. Transfer of hay from donor areas to severely damaged, seed-depleted peatland to restore fen meadows, was successful. However, despite short-term successes, complete restoration of wetland areas requires a long period of time.",Mire; Rewetting; Species introduction,Review,1999.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5138875842094421,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The United States Department of Energy (DOE) promotes information and knowledge sharing through various avenues, including the development and distribution of Best Practices Manuals (BPMs), the development of online tools and resources, involvement in working groups on CCUS, and other public outreach and education efforts. One of NETL's main initiatives to promote information and knowledge sharing is the development of a series of BPMs that outline uniform approaches to address a variety of CCUS-related issues and challenges. A major online resource developed by DOE is the National Carbon Sequestration Database and Geographic Information System (NATCARB), which is a geographic information system (GIS)-based tool developed to provide an interactive visual representation of CCUS potential. The series of past and future carbon storage Atlases featuring the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSPs), such as the to be released United States Carbon Utilization and Storage Atlas, complements NATCARB, and contains additional information regarding commercialization opportunities for CCUS technologies from each of DOE's RCSPs. Building on past successes, NETL is expanding the NATCARB effort through the North American Carbon Atlas Partnership (NACAP) to better assess CCUS potential throughout all of North America. NETL has been actively disseminating knowledge and developing the future required workforce through training centers that are focused on training personnel for future implementation of CCUS technology.",,CONF,2013.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5137282609939575,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
4913560,Countries' commitments to soil organic carbon in Nationally Determined Contributions,"Soil carbon is the major active pool of terrestrial carbon, and as such, soil organic carbon (SOC) targets, policies and measures will be pivotal to achieving global climate targets. SOC sequestration may reduce the net annual greenhouse gas emissions from Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use by between 3% and 71%, while simultaneously supporting various ecosystem services. Accurate SOC accounting and monitoring, however, is constrained by various technical challenges related to indicators, rates of SOC change, measuring the impact of management practices on SOC, and the long-term persistence of sequestered SOC. We assessed countries' pledges to the Paris Agreement for SOC in agriculture to better understand the level, transparency, and specificity of commitments. Reviewing 184 countries' initial Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), we considered whether SOC was included, what was pledged, the level of ambition promised and the specificity of mitigation targets. Twenty-eight countries referred to SOC in their NDCs, citing quantified or unquantified mitigation targets, national policies or programs, and actions and measures to be implemented in agricultural lands (14), peatlands (6) or wetlands (14). Countries' reasons for not including SOC in NDCs included the need to prioritize goals of sustainable development and food security above climate mitigation, a lack of incentives for farmers to improve management practices, and the difficulty of accurately monitoring changes in SOC. Including SOC targets in NDCs can improve NDCs' comprehensiveness and transparency to track and compare policy progress across NDCs; it can also leverage SOC-related climate finance, technical support, and capacity building. Key policy insights Many NDCs specify practices known to have the potential to achieve SOC sequestration or protection without explicitly mentioning SOC. The SOC-related mitigation potential of these practices can be quantified in future NDCs. NDCs are not presently a good indicator of countries' interest or commitment to SOC action at national level. To improve this, countries with existing SOC policies, programs, and actions can specify their SOC-related commitments in future NDCs. Increased collaboration between countries with experience managing SOC and countries needing support to develop SOC-related targets, policies, measures and incentives for land users and farmers would facilitate the provision of such needed support. To increase country commitments and attention to managing SOC, there is a need for improved SOC measurement and monitoring, for better evidence on the impacts of management practices on SOC, and for incentives for farmers to change practices and overcome barriers.",soil organic carbon; climate change; Paris Agreement; Nationally Determined Contribution; agriculture; policy,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5133138298988342,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

473915,Green grabs and biochar: Revaluing African soils and farming in the new carbon economy,"Biochar currently attracts technological and market optimism, promising multiple wins - for climate change, food security, bioenergy and health - not least for African farmers. This paper examines the political-economic and discursive processes constructing biochar as a novel green commodity, creating new alliances amongst scientists, businesses, venture capital firms and non-governmental organisations. Carbon market logics are not only threatening large-scale land grabs for biochar feedstocks but also other forms of resource, labour and ecological appropriation through driving research and development and shaping small-scale pilot projects. In these, soil carbon is 'chopped out' of its ecosystem and social contexts and revalued as exchangeable pieces of carbon nature. Farmers are hailed as green actors and market winners, provided they discipline their practices according to these new technical and market logics. These discourses contrast strongly with the farmers' existing conceptual and practical repertoires; a case study from Liberia illustrates how farmers already manipulate soil carbon in creating locally valued anthropogenic dark earths, but within diverse farming repertoires, ontologies of human-nature interrelationship and historical and political ecologies.",green grabbing; biochar; carbon market; farming; Africa,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5123040676116943,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
4676069,Encroached by pine and eucalyptus? A grounded theory on an environmental conflict between forest industry and smallholder livelihoods in Chile,"Plantation forestry has economic, social, and ecological potentials, such as the opportunity for jobs, income and economic development, or possible carbon storage and soil protection. However, plantation forestry, if inappropriately managed and spatially integrated, has been shown to raise environmental conflicts with stakeholders in the vicinity of plantations. To avoid and manage such conflicts, their root causes must be profoundly understood. Some conflicts have a distributional character and arise from differential or unjust access to resources. Others have causes that relate to perceptions and constructions of the natural environment, environmental values and norms and social legitimacy of livelihoods in the vicinity of plantation. Conflicts with such a constitutional character may become intractable if their root causes are not identified. This study addresses the situation of smallholders affected by the proximity of commercial forestry that has expanded vastly during the last decades. Based on a Grounded Theory approach, it disentangles the perceived impacts of pine and eucalyptus plantations on rural livelihoods. It shows that a profound environmental conflict is given, although this conflict is not prominent in the political discourse in Chile. The conflict consists of an ostensible level of conflict, which mainly relates to material impacts plantation impose to smallholder livelihoods. However, more profoundly, there is a fundamental conflict level, which comprises questions of illegitimacy of land use in the study site and a perceived erosion of rurality. It discusses potential strategies for conflict resolution and shows that current intents are prone to fail, since they address the ostensible level, but disregard the fundamental level of conflict. This conclusion is expected to shed light on the situation in other countries, where afforestation measures are currently undertaken. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5121001601219177,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

1867717,Prospects for application of CCS in Finland,"In this paper, the possibilities and conditions for CCS applications in Finland are assessed. The study includes an overview of Finland's current climate and energy policy framework, mapping of large CO2 emission point sources and identification of possible CO2 transportation and storage alternatives. The future role of CCS in the Finnish energy system is further assessed with energy and emission scenarios created with a comprehensive model called TIMES-Nordic. There are several large CO2 emission sources in Finland that could be potential candidates for CCS, including steel works, power and heat generating plants, as well as oil refineries. In 2008, the 12 largest facilities in the Finnish emission trading registry accounted for 30% of the total CO2 emissions in Finland. Since the Finnish bedrock is not suitable for large-scale geological storage of CO2, captured CO2 would most likely have to be transported to the North Sea or Barents Sea for long-term storage. Most of the largest CO2 emitting facilities are located on the coast line of Finland, which facilitates transportation of CO2 by ship. The current Finnish climate and energy policy largely focuses on increasing the share of renewable energy and nuclear power in energy conversion, which leaves less room for CCS. The preliminary results from the scenario calculations indicate that the share of CO2 mitigation by CCS in Finland would be less than 10 Mt/a CO2 by 2050. However, Finland has also large, stationary CO2 emissions originating from biomass combustion in the pulp and paper industry. When assuming that biogenic CO2 emissions would be included into the emission trading system, the CCS potential rises up to 18 Mt/a CO2 by 2050.

5302330,The Path to Net Zero,"This chapter describes how the world’s advanced industrial nations can “decarbonize” their economies. It focuses on actions to be taken in the energy, transportation, and industrial sectors as well as in buildings and construction. To meet the goal set in the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to well below 2 °C by 2050, economies must reduce to near-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Central to this effort is decarbonizing energy supplies and increasing the use of carbon-neutral electricity. Hard-to-abate industrial sectors such as steel and cement production will transition to low-carbon processes. Waste will be reduced, and our economies will become more circular. Carbon capture and sequestration may help the electricity generating sector through the transition to renewable energy. Direct air capture will help balance the carbon cycle that continues to be perturbed by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Government policies will enable the energy, transportation, and industrial changes to develop in the short timeframes that the current climate crisis requires. Finally, social attitudes and behavioral changes will augment decarbonization efforts at the margins and provide the necessary public support for policy changes. This chapter assumes that financing at the level needed to meet the climate challenge (see Chap. 6) is mobilized. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Book Chapter,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5117787718772888,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

While ambitious mitigation and adaptation are both needed, the ocean provides major opportunities for action to reduce climate change globally and its impacts on vital ecosystems and ecosystem services. A comprehensive and systematic assessment of 13 global- and local-scale, ocean-based measures was performed to help steer the development and implementation of technologies and actions toward a sustainable outcome. We show that (1) all measures have tradeoffs and multiple criteria must be used for a comprehensive assessment of their potential, (2) greatest benefit is derived by combining global and local solutions, some of which could be implemented or scaled-up immediately, (3) some measures are too uncertain to be recommended yet, (4) political consistency must be achieved through effective cross-scale governance mechanisms, (5) scientific effort must focus on effectiveness, co-benefits, disbenefits, and costs of poorly tested as well as new and emerging measures.",climate change; ocean acidification; ocean solutions; global; local; governance,Article,2018.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.511691689491272,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1635831,"Comparing the development and deployment of carbon capture and storage technologies in Norway, the Netherlands, Australia, Canada and the United States- An innovation system perspective","In order to take up the twin challenge of reducing CO2-emissions, while meeting a growing energy demand, the potential deployment of CCS is attracting a growing interest of policy makers around the world. In this study we evaluate and compare national approaches towards the development of CCS in the U. S. A, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway and Australia. The analysis is done by using the functions of innovation systems approach. This approach implicates that new technology is developed, demonstrated and deployed in the context of a technological innovation system. By the assessment made in this study the strengths and weaknesses of the innovation systems are identified, which is vital for the development of a coherent (long-term) policy strategy that enhance the successful implementation of CCS. The performance assessment and comparison of the CCS innovation systems shows that the extensive knowledge base and knowledge networks, which have been accumulated over the past years, has not yet been valorized by entrepreneurs to explore the market for integrated CCS concepts linked to power generation. This indicates that the build-up of the innovation system has entered a critical phase that is decisive for a further thriving development of CCS in Norway, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia and the USA. In order to move the CCS innovation systems through this present difficult episode and deploy more advanced CCS concepts at a larger scale; it is necessary to direct policy initiatives at the identified weak system functions, i.e. entrepreneurial activity, market formation and the mobilization of resources. Moreover, in some specific countries governmental guidance and the creation of legitimacy also needs more attention. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

624245,Impact of international climate policies on CO2 capture and storage deployment Illustrated in the Dutch energy system,"A greenhouse gas emission trading system is considered an important policy measure for the deployment of CCS at large scale. However, more insights are needed whether such a trading system leads to a sufficient high CO2 price and stable investment environment for CCS deployment. To gain more insights, we combined WorldScan, an applied general equilibrium model for global policy analysis, and MARKAL-NL-UU, a techno-economic energy bottom-up model of the Dutch power generation sector and CO2 intensive industry. WorldScan results show that in 2020, CO2 prices may vary between 20 E/tCO(2) in a GRAND COALITION scenario, in which all countries accept greenhouse gas targets from 2020, to 47 epsilon/tCO(2) in an IMPASSE scenario, in which EU-27 continues its one-sided emission trading system without the possibility to use the Clean Development Mechanism. MARKAL-NL-UU model results show that an emission trading system in combination with uncertainty does not advance the application of CCS in an early stage, the rates at which different CO2 abatement technologies (including CCS) develop are less crucial for introduction of CCS than the CO2 price development, and the combination of biomass (co-)firing and CCS seems an important option to realise deep CO2 emission reductions.

3798712,Contested framings of greenhouse gas removal and its feasibility: Social and political dimensions,"Prospective approaches for large-scale greenhouse gas removal (GGR) are now central to the post-2020 international commitment to pursue efforts to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees C. However, the feasibility of large-scale GGR has been repeatedly questioned. Most systematic analyses focus only on the physical, technical, and economic challenges of deploying it at scale. However, social and political dimensions will be just as important, if not more so, to how possible futures play out. We conduct one of the first reviews of the international peer-reviewed literature pertaining to the social and political dimensions of large-scale GGR, with a specific focus on two predominant approaches: Biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation/reforestation (AR). Our analysis of 78 studies proposes two important insights. First, it shows how six key social and political dimensions of GGR feasibility-namely economics and incentives; innovation; societal engagement; governance; complexity and uncertainty; and ethics, equity, and justice-are identifiable and are emphasized to varying degrees in the literature. Second, there are three contested ways in which BECCS and AR and their feasibility are being framed in the literature: (a) a techno-economic framing; (b) a social and political acceptability framing; and (c) a responsible development framing. We suggest this third frame will, and indeed should, become increasingly pertinent to the assessment, innovation, and governance of climate futures.

466625,Reducing CO2 emissions by making cheaper CO2 capture technologies available,"The Royal Dutch Shell Group (Shell)1 was one of the first energy companies to acknowledge the threat of climate change - to call for action by governments; our industry and energy users; and to take action ourselves. Shell's strategy: to expand our alternative energies portfolio, while investing in advanced CO2 solutions in order to improve oui ability to manage emissions from our hydrocarbon business. Measures to manage future emissions will include developing new technologies to capture and store CO2 underground. The pursuit of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) technologies allows Shell to play an important and leading role towards addressing the need for an increasing worldwide demand for energy, while at the same time dealing with the need to reduce global emissions. No single universal policy or technology will solve the CO2 challenge. Therefore, various CCS solutions will need to be considered within a portfolio of measures to reduce global CO2 emissions while assisting a transition towards a low-carbon energy future. Shell seeks to position itself as part of the solution to the climate change issue. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has identified C02 capture and storage (CCS) as the most promising for the rapid reduction of global emissions - by up to 55% by 21002. As the bridge to a more sustainable energy system, it is therefore a key solution for combating climate change - among a portfolio of solutions, including renewable energies, energy efficiency and biofuels In order to achieve deeper reductions in CO2 emissions there will need to be new technologies brought to the market to enable a 'Kyoto 2' type-agreement. Authorities such as the International Energy Agency, the European Union Commission for Research and the US Department of Energy predict that new technologies will include hydrogen fuels cells, clean coal technology, and storage of CO2 below ground - in deep saline formations or redundant reservoirs, or for enhanced oil recovery. Considerable attention is being focused on CO2 storage with the desire to reduce the cost of capture and storage below 25 $/t CO2. Shell has a special team working on the CO2 Capture Project (CCP) Joint Industry Project. For the CCP Shell carries out studies, manages projects and the team is involved evaluating opportunities for deployment of the technologies within Shell. Shell also provides the Vice Chairman for this initiative and has several key-players working on this project. CCP is an international collaboration among industry, governments, academics and environmental interest groups focused on developing technology for CO2 capture and geological storage. The CO2 Capture Team (CCT) conducts Shell's participation in the CO 2 Captare Project (CCP) and other external programs. CCT also works internally to apply external learnings and technologies within Shell businesses. Additionally, Shell's research and development funds and manages a separate CO2 storage program. Our goals are to: reduce the cost of capture by 60 to 80%, and demonstrate that geological storage can be secure. In addition to the CCP, Shell is involved in many other CO2 collaborations . A few of these are mentioned below: CO2CRC is a leading regional collaboration for capture and storage technology. Participants include international energy companies plus others from Australia and New Zealand. The Australian government helps with funding and organizational support. WESTCARB is a leading regional collaboration for infrastructure and demonstration. Participants include international energy companies plus others from the US West Coast. The US DoE helps with funding, including capital for an integrated demonstration. The IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme is a unique collaboration of governments and industry. It produces definitive reports for the participants, and sponsors the premier conference on capture and storage. The reports provide primary input to the IPCC. Participants include 18 governments and 17 multi-national companies. CCT participates on the executive committee. This paper further describes the CCP program, reviews the results of the completed CCP1 and provides an overview of the main technologies and activities of the current CCP2.

5346923,"An Indigenous ‘Right Way’ Environmental, Social and Cultural Core-Benefits Verification Standard","There is a lot of pressure on Indigenous people to conform, to think and act like Europeans. There is an unspoken belief that it would be much easier for all concerned to simply use European models and accepted western ways of doing things. Developing a new standard for the cultural, social and environmental core benefits of carbon projects that uses the Indigenous-to-Indigenous way of working has not been easy. It has involved a lot of thinking, reflection and discussion with many wonderful Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. It also involved more formal consultation and peer review processes as well as presentations at industry forums and community meetings. Ultimately, we do not see a role for non-Aboriginal people in leading this process nor are we ‘massaging’ a western monitoring and evaluation (M&E) model into an Aboriginal context. We can’t tweak existing standards whose soul is fundamentally different. There is, however, a support role for non-Aboriginal people which affords for a generosity of spirit to not dominate or dismiss Indigenous ways of working. The concept of Indigenous people working with Indigenous people using Indigenous expertise to verify core-benefits has been seen by some as an inferior process, a bit soft perhaps, lacking rigour even. The idea that Indigenous people have something to offer challenges the dominate neo-colonial concepts of dependence and is a form of environmental racism that needs to be called out. We are holding fast in our belief that in order to be part of the solution and to recognise Indigenous people’s expertise we cannot build the capacity of NGOs, government agencies and M&E specialists. We are fully aware this approach can be disarming because it requires ‘white experts’ to move aside. There are many intelligent Indigenous people with expertise that did not receive a formal education. On a personal level I have drawn inspiration for this work through my mother, a strong spiritual Badtjala (Butchulla) woman. As a child she was one of the ‘dump house mob’ spending four years of her childhood growing up on a rubbish dump, left school by grade 7, lost all her teeth by 16 years and started work as a domestic servant. Despite all these difficulties she raised four children all going to University, negotiated the first hand back of land on K’gari (Fraser Island) from the infamously conservative Joh Bjelke-Petersen Queensland Government and was instrumental in launching our successful Native Title claim. I have also drawn inspiration from Oodgeroo Noonuccal, Vincent Lingiari, Tony Tjamawa and Eddie Mabo. All of whom challenged the status quo for the benefit of Indigenous people. I would like to thank the Aboriginal Carbon Foundation team and Caritas Australia for their ideas, dedication and patience. I would also like to thank the Queensland Government for funding this innovative work. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Book Chapter,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.510016918182373,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5831,The United States Department of Energy's Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships program: A collaborative approach to carbon management,"This paper reviews the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSP) concept, which is a first attempt to bring the U.S. Deparment of Energy's (DOE) carbon sequestration program activities into the ""real world"" by using a geographically-disposed-system type approach for the U.S. Each regional partnership is unique and covers a unique section of the U.S. and is tasked with determining how the research and development activities of DOE's carbon sequestration program can best be implemented in their region of the country. Although there is no universal agreement on the cause, it is generally understood that global warming is occurring, and many climate scientists believe that this is due, in part, to the buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. This is evident from the finding presented in the National Academy of Science Report to the President on Climate Change which stated ""Greenhouse gases are accumulating in Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities, causing surface air temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise. Temperatures are, in fact, rising. The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities, ..."". In the United States, emissions of CO2 originate mainly from the combustion of fossil fuels for energy production, transportation, and other industrial processes. Roughly one third of U.S. anthropogenic CO2 emissions come from power plants. Reduction of CO2 emissions through sequestration of carbon either in geologic formations or in terrestrial ecosystems can be part of the solution to the problem of global warming. However, a number of steps must be accomplished before sequestration can become a reality. Cost effective capture and separation technology must be developed, tested, and demonstrated; a database of potential sequestration sites must be established; and techniques must be developed to measure, monitor, and verify the sequestered CO2 Geographical differences in fossil fuel use, the industries present, and potential sequestration sinks across the United States dictate the use of a regional approach to address the sequestration of CO2. To accommodate these differences, the DOE has created a nationwide network of seven Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSP) to help determine and implement the carbon sequestration technologies, infrastructure, and regulations most appropriate to promote CO2 sequestration in different regions of the nation. These partnerships currently represent 40 states, three Indian Nations, four Canadian Provinces, and over 200 organizations, including academic institutions, research institutions, coal companies, utilities, equipment manufacturers, forestry and agricultural representatives, state and local governments, non-governmental organizations, and national laboratories. These partnerships are dedicated to developing the necessary infrastructure and validating the carbon sequestration technologies that have emerged from DOE's core R&D and other programs to mitigate emissions of CO2, a potent greenhouse gas. The partnerships provide a critical link to DOE's plans for FutureGen, a highly efficient and technologically sophisticated coal-fired power plant that will produce both hydrogen and electricity with near-zero emissions. Though limited to the situation in the U.S., the paper describes for the international scientific community the approach being taken by the U.S. to prepare for carbon sequestration, should that become necessary.

Several geologic settings are appropriate for geologic storage of carbon dioxide (CO2), including depleted oil and gas reservoirs, deep brine-saturated formations, CO2 flood enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations, and enhanced coalbed methane recovery. The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is pursuing a vigorous program for demonstration of CCUS technology through its Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (RCSP) Program, which entered its third phase (Phase III) in October 2007. This phase is planned for a duration of ten U.S. federal fiscal years (October 2007 to September 2017), and its main focus is the characterization and monitoring of large-scale CO2 injection into geologic formations at CCUS sites. The Plains CO2 Reduction (PCOR) Partnership, led by the Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center (EERC), is one of seven regional partnerships established under the RCSP Program. The PCOR Partnership region includes all or part of nine U.S. states and four Canadian provinces (Figure 1) and is made up of numerous private and public sector groups (Figure 2) working to identify the most suitable CO2 storage strategies and technologies, aid in regulatory development, educate the general public, and investigate appropriate infrastructure for CCUS commercialization within its region. The Phase III program undertaken by the PCOR Partnership includes two commercial-scale projects that are of immediate interest to the oil and gas industry, namely the Fort Nelson carbon capture and storage (CCS) feasibility project and the Bell Creek combined CO2 EOR and storage project.",,CONF,2013.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.5095367431640625,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
167085,Argument map for carbon capture and storage,"Carbon capture and storage (CCS) can contribute to the deep CO2 cuts which are necessary to achieve climate change targets. There is, however, a strong public debate whether CCS should be implemented. In this article we give an overview of the arguments for and against based on the opinion of Dutch stakeholders. CCS is an umbrella term for a wide range of different configurations of separate technologies. Some arguments are applicable in general for all CCS chains; some are only valid for a particular configuration. In this paper we will discuss these arguments in the context of the background of different CCS configurations. The argument that CCS costs a lot of extra energy, for instance, is valid for the power sector, not for gas treatment. A good understanding of the CCS debate and the arguments used may help with developing a better energy policy and may give direction to future research and technology development.

The literature largely has focused on giving landowners direct incentives to store carbon. This paper explores an alternative mechanism to increase forest carbon sequestration by creating a market for wood bioenergy. By raising the value of wood, the program encourages landowners to convert vast amounts of land to forest, which incidentally increases forest carbon. By providing an indirect subsidy on woody biomass, governments can give even more incentive to reward this carbon sequestration.",BECCS; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Forestry; Integrated assessment model; Mitigation; Woody biomass,Article,2014.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5082627534866333,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
333813,Obstacles for CCS deployment: an analysis of discrepancies of perceptions,"The potential for CO2 emission reductions through carbon capture and storage (CCS) is depending on investments that can bring the technology from the current R&D through to commercial applications. The intermediate step in this development is demonstration plants that can prove the technical, economic, social, and ecological feasibility of CCS technologies. Based on a CCS stakeholder questionnaire survey and a literature review, we critically analyse discrepancies regarding perceptions of deployment obstacles and experiences from early demonstration plants. The analysis identifies discrepancies between CCS policies versus important deployment considerations and CCS stakeholder policy demands. The discrepancy gap is emphasised by lessons from restructured, postponed, and cancelled CCS projects. To bridge this cognitive gap towards proving CCS through demonstration activities, the article highlights policy implications of establishing a broad understanding of deployment obstacles. Attention to these obstacles is important for policymakers and industry in channelling efforts to demonstrating CCS, hence validating the current focus on CCS as a key abatement potential. Under present conditions, the findings question the robustness of current CCS abatement potential estimates and deployment goals as established by policymakers and in scenarios.",Abatement potential; Carbon capture and storage; Demonstration; Deployment; Risk; Stakeholder analysis,Article,2012.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.5077671408653259,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
4912603,Green and Blue Infrastructure in Darwin; Carbon Economies and the Social and Cultural Dimensions of Valuing Urban Mangroves in Australia,"Darwin's mangrove ecosystems, some of the most extensive and biodiverse in the world, are part of the urban fabric in the tropical north of Australia but they are also clearly at risk from the current scale and pace of development. Climate motivated market-based responses, the so-called 'new-carbon economies', are one prominent approach to thinking differently about the value of living infrastructure and how it might provide for and improve liveability. In the Australian context, there are recent efforts to promote mangrove ecosystems as blue infrastructure, specifically as blue carbon, but also little recognition or valuation of them as green or urban infrastructure. Drawing on observational and qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews, this study examines how key stakeholders in Darwin frame and understand mangroves in relation to the urban, and how they are anticipating and responding to governance efforts to frame mangroves and pay for their carbon sequestration and storage services as blue carbon. The push for large infrastructure development and an expanding urban footprint, present serious challenges for mangrove protection, and the study evidences both denial and complacency in this regard. However, although the concept of blue carbon is already taking effect in some circles, it was not viewed as straightforward or as appropriate by all study participants and may very well work in practice to exclude groups within the community. Both clear governance problems, as well as unrecognized and vernacular community connections to mangroves in Darwin, indicate that there are ongoing conceptual and empirical challenges to be considered in recognizing and valuing mangroves as part of urban life.",green infrastructure; blue infrastructure; mangroves; Darwin; Australia; social and cultural values; carbon economies; urban forest,Article,2019.0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0.5075826644897461,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
677051,"Fire and carbon management in a diversified rangelands economy: research, policy and implementation challenges for northern Australia","Burning of savanna is a globally important source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In Australia, burning of savanna contributes between 2% and 4% annually of the nation's reportable emissions. Complete removal of this source of emissions is unrealistic because fire is a ubiquitous natural process and important land-management tool. In the rangelands of northern Australia, fire is used to manage habitat for conservation, control woodland thickening, manipulate pastures for grazing and is an essential component of indigenous cultural and land-management practice. There has been a concerted attempt in recent times to move away from complete fire suppression and its consequence: frequent, extensive and high intensity wildfires occurring late in the dry season. In fire-adapted vegetation types, prescribed early dry season fires help reduce the incidence of late season wildfires and consequently the amount of GHG emissions produced. The emergence of a carbon economy affords a potential opportunity for land managers to diversify their livelihoods by adopting fire-management practices that reduce GHG emissions and increase carbon sequestration. However, in order to realise benefits from this emerging economy, there is a need to identify and address a range of barriers affecting community participation. The papers in this Special Issue document current scientific knowledge, policy issues and pathways to participation, with particular reference to Australia's savanna rangelands.

1867617,The Plains CO2 Reduction (PCOR) Partnership: Developing Carbon Management Options for the Central Interior of North America,"The Plains CO2 Reduction (PCOR) Partnership has developed a regional vision for the widespread commercial development of carbon capture and storage (CCS). This regional vision includes several key elements: 1) targeting relatively low-cost anthropogenic CO2 sources such as gas-processing facilities; 2) employing CO2-based enhanced oil recovery (EOR) opportunities as initial sink targets whenever the economics and geology are favorable; 3) using the existing oil and gas regulatory structure and agencies for oversight; 4) developing a protocol for the establishment of geologic sequestration units that is based on the standard oil field practice of unitization; 5) developing rigorous site selection criteria that will allow for the adoption of commercially viable monitoring, verification, and accounting (MVA) procedures; 6) developing integrated risk management, MVA, and simulation project plans that continue to evolve as the project progresses and more data become available; and 7) developing the technical information needed for our commercial partners to ultimately monetize carbon credits to reduce the costs of CCS projects. The realization of this vision will result in the development of commercial CCS projects, both saline formation injection and EOR-based opportunities in the PCOR Partnership region, which has very favorable geology and socioeconomic conditions for the widespread adoption of CCS.

573280,Dual high-stake emerging technologies: a review of the climate engineering research literature,"The literature on climate engineering, or geoengineering, covers a wide range of potential methods for solar radiation management or carbon dioxide removal that vary in technical aspects, temporal and spatial scales, potential environmental impacts, and legal, ethical, and governance challenges. This paper presents a comprehensive review of social and natural science papers on this topic since 2006 and listed in SCOPUS andWeb of Science. It adds to previous literature reviews by combining analyses of bibliometric patterns and of trends in how the technologies are framed in terms of content, motivations, stakes, and recommendations. Most peer-reviewed climate engineering literature does not weigh the risks and new, additional, benefits of the various technologies, but emphasizes either the potential dangers of climate engineering or the climate change consequences of refraining from considering the research, development, demonstration, and/ or deployment of climate engineering technologies. To analyse this polarity, not prevalent in the literature on earlier emerging technologies, we explore the concept of dual high-stake technologies. As appeals to fear have proven ineffective in spurring public engagement in climate change, we may not expect significant public support for climate engineering technologies whose rationale is not to achieve benefits in addition to avoiding the high stakes of climate change. Furthermore, in designing public engagement exercises, researchers must be careful not to steer discussions by emphasizing one type of stake framing over another. A dual high-stake, rather than risk-benefit, framing should also be considered in analysing some emerging technologies with similar characteristics, for example, nanotechnology for pollution control.

5187012,Natural carbon removal as technology,"Lay people tend to prefer natural solutions for carbon removal over technological ones. Researchers have argued that all carbon removal methods can be seen as “natural.” Here I argue that it is also in practice necessary to see all carbon removal methods as “technological,” that is, standardized, engineered, machine-like, enclosed systems. Natural carbon removal methods are complex socio-natural-technical messy systems that interact in complex ways with their environments. But to work well in practice as an option in climate policy—including in any emissions trading or offsetting schemes—they simultaneously need to be framed in much narrower terms, to be accountable (modellable, tradeable). And there will be efforts to not just frame, but physically make natural carbon removal as standardized, engineered, machine-like and enclosed as possible—although doomed to never be fully successful. It is in these senses that all carbon removal is technological. The ambiguity between an often vague framing as natural, a narrowly technological framing, and a wider socio-natural-technical framing, matters for public understanding and acceptance. Would lay publics still prefer natural solutions to carbon removal, if they are informed about the inevitable technological framing and shaping of them? Research is needed about this. It also matters for the risk of mitigation deterrence. Previous research shows that the narrow framing, of carbon removal methods as technology is implicated in societal processes that deter efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

315996,Carbon dioxide removal and the futures market,"Futures contracts are exchange-traded financial instruments that enable parties to fix a price in advance, for later performance on a contract. Forward contracts also entail future settlement, but they are traded directly between two parties. Futures and forwards are used in commodities trading, as producers seek financial security when planning production. We discuss the potential use of futures contracts in Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) markets; concluding that they have one principal advantage (near-term price security to current polluters), and one principal disadvantage (a combination of high price volatility and high trade volume means contracts issued by the private sector may cause systemic economic risk). Accordingly, we note the potential for the development of futures markets in CDR, but urge caution about the prospects for market failure. In particular, we consider the use of regulated markets: to ensure contracts are more reliable, and that moral hazard is minimised. While regulation offers increased assurances, we identify major insufficiencies with this approach-finding it generally inadequate. In conclusion, we suggest that only governments can realistically support long-term CDR futures markets. We note existing long-term CDR plans by governments, and suggest the use of state-backed futures for supporting these assurances.",forward contracts; futures markets; carbon dioxide removal; negative emissions technologies; voluntary carbon offsets,Letter,2017.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5020426511764526,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

365672,The carbon credits market evolves to maintain the climate under control,"A carbon market began being created as a reconciliation alternative between maintaining climate equilibrium and economic development. When a country purchases carbon, it buys the rights to burn it, while the nation that sells it waives its right to do so. The value of carbon would be based on a country's capacity to sequester it or prevent that it be released in the atmosphere. According to World Bank data, Brazil's participation in the carbon market is roughly 10%, which amounts to more than $1.3 billion. the carbon credits generated by Brazilian forests would allow for a series of CDM projects, creating opportunities not only to combat global warming, but also ones that encourage reforestation.

5231478,Comparative Analysis of Carbon Capture and Storage Finance Gaps and the Social Cost of Carbon,"This paper evaluates how changes in economic market and policy conditions, including the establishment of a per-unit tax on unabated emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) set equal to estimates of the social cost of carbon (SCC), influence the economics of carbon capture and storage (CCS) for two hypothetical power generation facilities located in the United States. Data are provided from modified versions of models and resources created and managed by the National Energy Technology Laboratory. Changes in economic market and policy conditions are evaluated over a series of scenarios in which differences in the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) provide estimates of the financial gap necessary to overcome for CCS to be considered the cost-minimizing choice for each power generation facility type considered. Results suggest that for the coal and natural gas power generation facilities considered, a per-unit tax set equal to an SCC exceeding $123 per metric ton of CO2 (/tCO(2)) emitted (2018 dollars) and $167/tCO(2) emitted, respectively, in combination with current Section 45Q tax credits, yields investment in CCS as the cost-minimizing choice; SCC values as low as $58/tCO(2) and $98/tCO(2) can make CCS the cost-minimizing choice with additional support policies (e.g., free transportation and storage options).",social cost of carbon; carbon capture and storage; negative externality; financial gaps; economic efficiency,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0.5003105401992798,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0

1253550,"Revisiting the Factors Shaping Outcomes for Forest and Landscape Restoration in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Way Forward for Policy, Practice and Research","A lack of systematic understanding of the elements that determine the success of forest and landscape restoration (FLR) investments leads to the inability to clearly articulate strategic and practical approaches to support natural resource restoration endeavors across Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). This review examines the different challenges and opportunities for effective restoration interventions. Using a structured literature review, we draw evidence from a broad range of scholarly works on natural resource conservation and governance to investigate the early dynamics of FLR in SSA. We first engage in a contextual clarification of FLR concepts and then provide a synthesis of the factors that influence the results of FLR interventions at the social and institutional level to inform relevant restoration stakeholders-policy makers, investors, and practitioners. The review finds that several interacting factors shape the outcomes of FLR interventions. We classified them into three categories based on their features, intensity, and scale of occurrence: (1) micro-scale factors that enable or limit individual engagement in FLR and sustainable management practices; (2) project/program-level factors, including the design and implementation stages; and (3) institutional, policy, and governance factors, and issues of inequity that operate at the local or national government scale. The review goes beyond underscoring funding constraints as a major challenge to the up-and out-scaling of restoration interventions and FLR success.

485658,Managing United States Public Lands in Response to Climate Change: A View From the Ground Up,"Federal land managers are faced with the task of balancing multiple uses and goals when making decisions about land use and the activities that occur on public lands. Though climate change is now well recognized by federal agencies and their local land and resource managers, it is not yet clear how issues related to climate change will be incorporated into on-the-ground decision making within the framework of multiple use objectives. We conducted a case study of a federal land management agency field office, the San Juan Public Lands Center in Durango, CO, U.S.A., to understand from their perspective how decisions are currently made, and how climate change and carbon management are being factored into decision making. We evaluated three major management sectors in which climate change or carbon management may intersect other use goals: forests, biofuels, and grazing. While land managers are aware of climate change and eager to understand more about how it might affect land resources, the incorporation of climate change considerations into everyday decision making is currently quite limited. Climate change is therefore on the radar screen, but remains a lower priority than other issues. To assist the office in making decisions that are based on sound scientific information, further research is needed into how management activities influence carbon storage and resilience of the landscape under climate change.",Climate change; Carbon management; Land use; Public lands; Federal agencies; Forestry; Fuels management; Decision making,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4912882447242737,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
5331558,Negative Emissions: Priorities for Research and Policy Design,"The large-scale removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is likely to be important in maintaining temperature rise “well below” 2°C, and vital in achieving the most stringent 1.5°C target. Whilst various literature efforts have estimated the global potential of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) for a range of technologies with different degrees of certainty, regional bottlenecks for their deployment remain largely overlooked. Quantifying these barriers, through national and local case studies, rather than with aggregated approaches, would guide policy and research, as well as investments, toward regions that are likely to play a prominent role in CDR deployment. Five CDR technologies—including afforestation/reforestation, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage, biochar, direct air capture and enhanced weathering—are compared in this work. We discuss main technical, socio-economic and regulatory bottlenecks that have been scarcely investigated at regional level, and provide directions for further research. We identify the availability of accessible land, water, low carbon energy and CO2 storage as key regional drivers and bottlenecks to most CDR technologies. We discuss the caveats in CO2 accounting in assessing the performance of each technology, and the need for an international regulatory framework which captures these differences. Finally, we highlight the social, economic and political drivers which are central in unlocking the large scale deployment of CDR technologies, in a cost attractive, socially acceptable and politically achievable way.

301771,Expert views - and disagreements - about the potential of energy technology R&D,"Mitigating climate change will require innovation in energy technologies. Policy makers are faced with the question of how to promote this innovation, and whether to focus on a few technologies or to spread their bets. We present results on the extent to which public R&D might shape the future cost of energy technologies by 2030. We bring together three major expert elicitation efforts carried out by researchers at UMass Amherst, Harvard, and FEEM, covering nuclear, solar, Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), bioelectricity, and biofuels. The results show experts believe that there will be cost reductions resulting from R&D and report median cost reductions around 20 % for most of the technologies at the R&D budgets considered. Although the improvements associated to solar and CCS R&D show some promise, the lack of consensus across studies, and the larger magnitude of the R&D investment involved in these technologies, calls for caution when defining what technologies would benefit the most from additional public R&D. In order to make R&D funding decisions to meet particular goals, such as mitigating climate change or improving energy security, or to estimate the social returns to R&D, policy makers need to combine the information provided in this study on cost reduction potentials with an analysis of the macroeconomic implications of these technological changes.

680979,"Article 3.3 and 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol: Consequences for industrialised countries' commitment, the monitoring needs, and possible side effects","In the Kyoto Protocol, industrialised countries have agreed to reduce their carbon dioxide emissions. To achieve that target, direct human induced activities initiated in the Land-use Change and Forestry sector since 1990, shall be included. However, the wording in the Protocol has caused confusion. The IPCC has been requested to deliver a Special Report on Land-use, Land-use Change and Forestry issues arising from this Protocol. In the present study a limited initial assessment of the implications of alternative interpretations of Afforestation, Reforestation and Deforestation (ARD), addition of the soils compartment, the selection of additional activities, and feasibility of monitoring was done for a limited number of countries. The results show that it is possible to keep the biosphere articles in the Protocol even though we had to make several assumptions concerning for example, areas of application and effectiveness of additional activities. The consequences of alternative interpretations for ARD have a large impact on the countries' assigned amount; varying from a compensation of 26% of total national emissions (Forestry interpretation for Sweden) to an addition of an extra 13% of the emissions (Global interpretation for Australia). Through selection of a large set of additional activities, most of the studied industrialised countries achieve more sequestration than the reduction of emissions they have committed themselves to. Methods for monitoring are available, but there is no one ideal method.

4374520,Community compensation in the context of Carbon Capture and Storage: Current debates and practices,"Societal opposition has the potential to slow down the implementation of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). One of the difficulties is that the perceived benefits associated with a CCS facility for local communities tend to be low compared to its perceived burdens. As is the case for other low carbon technologies, community compensation (or community benefits) has been suggested as a way to restore this perceived imbalance. A diverse literature has looked into the role of community compensation across various land uses and research fields. Synthesis is limited, while at the same time, the provision of community compensation in practice is moving from an ad hoc to a more institutionalized approach. Therefore, it is important to take stock of the literature. This paper provides a review of the community compensation literature in the form of four debates, drawing together environmental social science research on different low carbon technologies (e.g. CCS, renewable energy). In addition, current practices in community compensation for four European countries are discussed. The two parts of this paper are brought together in a set of lessons for the provision of community compensation for future CCS projects; in turn, suggestions for further research are made to address remaining knowledge gaps.",Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS); Community compensation; Community benefits; Community engagement; Acceptance,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4822536706924438,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

Several involve new accounting structures which are quite different from the rules established in the Marrakech Accords and related decisions. However, a mechanism based largely on the structure agreed for the first commitment period also has its benefits.

498239,Tackling CO2 reduction in India through use of CO2 capture and storage (CCS): Prospects and challenges,"CO2 capture and storage (CCS) is not currently a priority for the Government of India (GOI) because, whilst a signatory to the UNFCCC and Kyoto Protocol, there are no existing greenhouse gas emission reduction targets and most commentators do not envisage compulsory targets for India in the post-2012 phase. The overwhelming priority for the GOI is to sustain a high level of economic growth (8%+) and provision of secure, reliable energy (especially electricity) is one of the widely recognised bottlenecks in maintaining a high growth rate. In such a supply-starved context, it is not easy to envisage adoption of CCS-which increases overall generation capacity and demand for coal without increasing actual electricity supply-as being acceptable. Anything which increases costs-even slightly-is very unlikely to happen, unless it is fully paid for by the international community. The majority viewpoint of the industry and GOI interviewees towards CCS appears to be that it is a frontier technology, which needs to be developed further in the Annex-1 countries to bring down the cost through RD&D and deployment. More RD&D is required to assess in further detail the potential for CO2 storage in geological reservoirs in India and the international community has an important role to play in cultivating such research.

1868163,An update on the South African Pilot CO2 Storage Project,"South Africa is reliant on fossil fuels. These fossil fuels are important to economic development, being the most dependable, cost-effective energy source currently available in this country however, their conventional use results in significant CO2 emissions for the country. South Africa will require a portfolio of technologies to reduce its CO2 emissions however with a heavily coal-based economy, CCS is likely to be a particularly important part of this portfolio. To assess the technical potential for CCS in South Africa, the South African Centre for Carbon Capture and Storage (SACCCS) was established in 2009 as a public-private research collaboration. The current focus of SACCCS is the development of the Pilot CO2 Storage Project (PCSP) which will inject and store between 10-50,000tCO(2) in South African conditions. With the development of the PCSP now underway, there has been significant progress to date, in particular in the areas of funding, permitting and stakeholder engagement where around USD 50 million has been raised for the project, a request for approval for basin exploration submitted, and a significant number of stakeholders engaged. There have however also been some delays with the development of the PCSP, particularly following the PCSP Advisory Committee (PAC) review of geological analysis done to date for the Zululand and Algoa Basins. The PAC recommended that more information could yet be extracted from the existing data prior to deciding whether or not to progress to the acquisition of new geological data (Gate 2 Review). SACCCS is now working on the implementation of the PAC Review recommendations and the development of Gate 2 Deliverables in preparation for the Gate 2 Review.

Infrastructure needs to implement those limits are technologies to remove most carbon from electric generation emissions, technologies to dispose of the carbon removed, sensing systems to monitor carbon emissions, and market or regulatory structures to implement the limits. Adaptation to climate change will require upgrades and capacity increases in existing transmission and distribution systems, and increased capacity in new systems. Increased use of renewable can reduce carbon emissions. Higher penetrations of intermittent renewable resources, wind and solar, will be allowed if storage is available to allow full dispatch of those generators. Infrastructure needs for energy storage are efficient and cost-competitive technologies to store electricity, power electronic interfaces between those dc technologies and the ac power system, and monitoring and control systems to control and dispatch the storage systems. © 2007 IEEE.",Climate change; Energy storage; Global warming; Infrastructure; Renewable energy; Sustainability; Energy storage; Global warming; Regulatory compliance; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Carbon emissions; Sensing systems; Electric industry,Conference Paper,2007.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4768313467502594,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

However, guidelines for achieving the socio-economic and environmental objectives of the CDM, and other concerns with sinks projects, have yet to be elaborated. Independently of the Kyoto process, international efforts have advanced to define and certify sustainably managed forests through processes, such as that of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). In this paper, the FSC-US principles and criteria for sustainable forest management are evaluated in light of current concerns for guiding afforestation and reforestation projects in the CDM. It is found that the FSC criteria would help to meet some of the objectives of the Kyoto Protocol, including provisions to reduce the risk of premature carbon loss, and features that could somewhat lessen leakage of emissions outside the project area. Existing FSC monitoring and verification procedures provide some, but insufficient, overlap with expected requirements for measuring carbon stock changes. FSC principles and criteria articulate stringent guidelines for meeting environmental and social goals that reflect years of negotiations between environmental, timber, human rights and labor interests.

Although independently defined, the two agreements are strongly interlinked. We developed a framework that scores the impacts of climate-change actions on all SDG targets based on directionality (i.e., trade-offs or co-benefits) and likelihood of occurrence (i.e., ubiquitous or context-dependent), and categorizes them by dependence on four key context dimensions-geographical, governance, time horizon and limited natural resources. Through an extensive literature review, we found that climate-change mitigation measures directly affect most SDGs and their targets, mostly through co-benefits. Improving energy efficiency, reducing energy-services demand and switching to renewables provide the most co-benefits. In contrast, carbon capture and storage and nuclear energy likely lead to multiple trade-offs. We show how understanding the relevant context dimensions facilitates policy design and policy mixes that enhance co-benefits and minimize trade-offs. Finally, by assessing the prevalence of climate-change mitigation measures in G20 countries, we found that measures with more co-benefits are more frequently adopted. Our study advances the knowledge of climate-SDG interactions, contributing to climate and sustainable development governance research, and facilitating policy design for a joint implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda.",climate change; sustainable development goals; climate-change policy; policy coherence; G20; domestic policies,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4708618819713592,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

In February 2011 the inaugural Climate Change Research Strategy for Primary Industries (CCRSPI) conference was held to discuss the current state of climate change research across Australia's primary industries. Never before had policy makers, producers and scientists from all sectors of our primary industries been brought together in one event to focus on the challenges and opportunities of climate change. This conference was a unique forum to address those challenges and opportunities by sharing knowledge across the various sectors, scientific disciplines and the industry-policy-science divide. While this collection of review papers provides an excellent knowledge base for industry and government to plan and implement policy and make further research investments to address the obvious gaps there is still much to be done in terms of research and the co-ordination of research. The often unrelated research activity in the adaptation and mitigation components of climate change research have the potential to have either synergistic or antagonistic outcomes at several scales and in several sectors ranging from policy to industry and community. The significant injection of research and development funds into this area through the Carbon Farming Futures and other associated programs will provide further impetus to the need for national co-ordination of climate change research in Australia's Primary Industries. To build on all this knowledge and experience gained at the 2011 CCRSPI Conference, CCRSPI is currently (2012) finalising the national climate change research strategy for the sector, with an associated audit of existing projects and capacity, in order to encourage and advocate the cross-sectoral RDE needs and co-ordination for the future.",,Editorial Material,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4707213342189789,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The small mountain country of Nepal provides an excellent context in which to examine trajectories of forest-cover change. Despite having experienced large-scale forest clearing in the past, significant reforestation has taken place in recent years. The range of biophysical and ecological environments and diversity of tenure arrangements provide us with a context with sufficient variation to be able to derive insight into the impact of a range of hypothesized drivers of forest change. This article draws on a dataset of 55 forests from the middle hills and Terai plains of Nepal to examine the factors associated with forest clearing or regeneration. Results affirm the central importance of tenure regimes and local monitoring for forest regrowth. In addition, user group size per unit of forest area is an important, independent explanator of forest change. These variables also can be associated with specific practices that further influence forest change such as the management of social conflict, adoption of new technologies to reduce pressure on the forest, and involvement of users in forest maintenance activities.

Retrofit energy supply-chains, from generation to end product, encompass fossil fuel energy generation with retrofitted carbon capture and storage (CCS), for clean energy [hydrogen] output. Three research questions are posited: can an energy security framework be identified for analysis of fossil fuel retrofit hydrogen exports; what findings arise from applying the framework to a case study of Australian exports of coal-generated hydrogen to Japan; and are such international energy systems compromised by suboptimal carbon-emitting supply chains, with potential implications for global energy justice? A systematic literature review identified a modified framework, further developed in this article to catalyse global energy security-justice analysis; contributing a useful energy security-justice tool. Applying the framework, findings illustrate key opportunities in Australia/Japan's energy diversification, supply security, and bilateral trade-strategic security relationships. Key risks include emissions and economic costs, risks in the production process, shipping complexities, and doubts concerning CCS. Interests of conservative politics and pro-coal/CCS influencers dominate how security is framed, deprioritising energy justice concerns and privileging coal interests and mining jobs over potentially more resilient renewable energy pathways and jobs. The research has implications for future research, policy development and energy system planning. Crown Copyright (c) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The social scientists in the room were supposed to form the dominant voice but with so many stuck in a snow storm, the balance of expertise shifted, as it often does when social scientists collaborate with natural and physical scientists. The outcomes of that workshop, lessons learned and opportunities missed, form the basis of this commentary, and they collectively indicate the barriers to integrating the natural, physical and social sciences on CDR. As the need for rapid, effective and successful CDR has only increased since that time, we argue that CDR researchers from across the spectrum must come together in ways that simultaneously address the technical, social, political, economic and cultural elements of CDR development, commercialization, adoption and diffusion if the academy is to have a material impact on climate change in the increasingly limited window we have to address it.",social science; climate change; carbon dioxide reduction,Editorial Material,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4590820968151092,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

2623517,The European Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage Laboratory Infrastructure (ECCSEL),"The transition to a non-emitting energy mix for power generation will take decades. This transition will need to be sustainable, e.g. economically affordable. Fossil fuels which are abundant have an important role to play in this respect, provided that Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) is progressively implemented. CCS is the only way to reduce emissions from energy intensive industries. Thus, the need for upgraded and new CCS research facilities is widely recognised among stakeholders across Europe, as emphasised by the Zero Emissions Platform (ZEP) [1] and the European Energy Research Alliance on CCS (EERA-CCS) [2]. The European Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Laboratory Infrastructure, ECCSEL, provides funders, operators and researchers with significant benefits by offering access to world-class research facilities that, in many cases, are unlikely for a single nation to support in isolation. This implies creation of synergy and the avoidance of duplication as well as streamlining of funding for research facilities. ECCSEL offers open access to its advanced laboratories for talented scientists and visiting researchers to conduct cutting-edge research. In the planning of ECCSEL, gap analyses were performed and CCS technologies have been reviewed to underpin and envisage the future experimental setup; 1) Making use of readily available facilities, 2) Modifying existing facilities, and 3) Planning and building entirely new advanced facilities. The investments required for the first ten years (2015-2025) are expected to be in the range of (sic)80-120 million. These investments show the current level of ambition, as proposed during the preparatory phase (2011-2014). Entering the implementation phase in 2015, 9 European countries signed Letter of Intent (Lol) to join a ECCSEL legal entity: France, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Poland, Greece, Norway and Switzerland (active observer). As the EU ERIC-regulation [3] would offer the most suitable legal framework for ECCSEL, the host country, Norway, will apply for establishing ERIC as the ECCSEL Research Infrastructure (RI) legal entity in 2017. Until the ECCSEL ERIC is approved by the European Commission (probably by summer 2017), an interim MoU agreement for the implementation phase of ECCSEL RI has been signed by 13 research institutions and universities representing the 9 countries. A consortium of these partners were granted 3 million EURO from Horizon 2020 to boost implementation of ECCSEL from September 2015 and two years onwards.

CCS technology is being shaped and developed within technological innovation system. The strength and composition of actor-networks in this system make a significant impact on CCS technology development. In order to facilitate the build-up of CCS innovation system, this study analyzes the actors-networks of CCS innovation system in China and the U.S, based on social-networks analysis. It is argued that there are huge differences between China and the U.S's CCS innovation system.

We draw from the literature on landscape multifunctionality, which has primarily been applied to agricultural settings, and propose opportunities to develop urban green infrastructure that could contribute to the sustainable social and ecological health of the city. Thinking in terms of system resilience, strategies might focus on the potential for green infrastructure to allow for adaptation and even transformation in the face of future challenges such as climate change, food insecurity, and limited resources. Because planning for multiple functions can be difficult when many diverse stakeholders are involved, we explored decision support tools that could be applied to green infrastructure planning in the early stages, to engage the public and encourage action toward implementing a preferred solution. Several specific ecosystem services that could be relevant for evaluating current and future urban green spaces include: plant biodiversity, food production, microclimate control, soil infiltration, carbon sequestration, visual quality, recreation, and social capital. Integrating such ecosystem services into small-scale greening projects could allow for creativity and local empowerment that would inspire broader transformation of green infrastructure at the city level. Those cities committing to such an approach by supporting greening projects are likely to benefit in the long run through the value of ecosystem services for urban residents and the broader public.",Social-ecological systems; Resilience; Transformation; Multifunctionality; Green infrastructure,Review,2013.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.451983630657196,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
573334,The long way from Kyoto to Marrakesh: Implications of the Kyoto Protocol negotiations for global ecology,"The Sixth and Seventh Conference of the Parties (COP 6 and 7) at The Hague, Bonn and Marrakesh came to a final Agreement on the Kyoto Protocol, which is thus ready for ratification by the individual nations. The Agreement was only achieved by allowing countries to offset their fossil fuel emission targets (on average 95% of the 1990 emissions) by increasing biological carbon sequestration, and by trading carbon credits. Activities that would count as increasing biological carbon sequestration include afforestation and reforestation, and changes in management of agriculture and forestry. According to the Agreement reached in Marrakesh, biological carbon sequestration may reach an offset of up to 80% of the required reduction in fossil fuel emissions (4% of the 5% reduction commitment). We explain why the allowable offset rose as high during the course of the negotiations. It is highlighted that major unintended consequences may be a result of the policy as it stands in the Marrakesh Accord. Major losses of biodiversity and primary forest are expected. We present scientific concerns regarding verification, which lead to scientific doubts that the practices encouraged by the Agreement can actually increase sequestration under a full carbon accounting scheme. We explain that there is a 'win-win' option that would protect high carbon pools and biodiversity in an economically efficient way. But, this is not supported by the Agreement. Despite the very positive signal that most nations of the United Nations will devote major efforts towards climate protection, there remains a most urgent need to develop additional rules to avoid unintended outcomes, and to promote the 'win-win' options that we explain.",biodiversity; carbon accounting; carbon-cycle management; Kyoto protocol,Editorial Material,2002.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4510892033576965,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5342858,Moral hazard or not? The effects of learning about carbon dioxide removal on perceptions of climate mitigation in the United States,"Geoengineering technologies are increasingly proposed as a necessary strategy to address climate change. How does the prospect of these technologies affect public support for traditional mitigation strategies that involve emission reductions? Recent research yields mixed results. Some evidence points to a moral hazard or risk compensation effect (i.e., less support for climate change mitigation). Other research finds evidence of heightened risk salience (i.e., more support for climate change mitigation), and still other work finds no effect at all. Focusing on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, we investigate whether these inconsistent findings result from differences in how the technologies are described against the backdrop of climate change. Specifically, we examine whether including explicit information (or not) about the impacts of climate change alters how information about CDR is received. Building on previous work, we designed two experiments to elucidate the circumstances under which information about CDR elicits a risk compensatory, risk salience, or null response among the public. Results predominantly align with a null effect from CDR information, although mixed results in Study 1 suggest the possibility of a very small risk compensation effect, depending on whether political ideology is controlled for. There was no evidence of a risk salience effect. However, information about the impacts of climate change increased perceived threat and, indirectly, policy support. We, thus, recommend that future studies of risk compensation and risk salience effects account for the provision of climate impacts information and political ideology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",,Article,2022.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4497388303279876,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
189644,Trends toward 100% renewable electricity supply in Germany and Europe: a paradigm shift in energy policies,"In industrialized countries such as Germany, electricity production contributes 30-40% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the country. Confronted with GHG emission reductions targets of 80-95% by 2050 and with some GHG emitting sectors confronted with great difficulties to reach such targets, such as agriculture, the power sector will need to reduce its GHG emissions virtually to zero. As nuclear energy involves very substantial accident risks and the unsolved problem of safe long-term deposit of nuclear waste and as carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) has rather limited safe storage potentials at least in Europe, the question arises, whether it will be possible to supply 100% of all necessary electricity from renewable energy sources? We show that a fast expanding volume of analyses underlines the feasibility and reliability of 100% renewable electricity supply systems. This fast mounting evidence appears to mark the beginning of a paradigm shift in energy politics, as highly regarded national and international advisory bodies such as the IPCC or the German Council of Environmental Advisors start to adopt this perspective. The example of the highly publicized study of the German Council of Environmental Advisors shows how a 100% renewable electricity system for Germany, Europe, and North Africa could look in 2050 and how the transition toward such a system could be achieved. This study, conducted with major input from the authors, is used to show the major aspects of a 100% renewable electricity supply system, such as the security of supply in every hour of the year, the compensation of intermittent sources such as wind and solar PV energy by other renewables and expanded storage, and the necessary extension of national and international grid infrastructures.

1563557,Promoting “4 Per Thousand” and “Adapting African Agriculture” by south-south cooperation: Conservation agriculture and sustainable intensification,"The “4 per Thousand” and “Adapting African Agriculture” are bold and innovative initiatives adopted at COP21 in Paris and COP22 in Marrakesh, respectively. These initiatives are soil-centric and based on adoption of soil-restorative and improved agricultural practices. The objective of this article is to discuss the merits and challenges of South–South Cooperation (SSC) in promoting the adoption of best management practices (BMPs) such as conservation agriculture (CA) and sustainable intensification (SI). Basic principles of CA are: retention of crop residue mulch, incorporation of cover crops and complex rotations, integrated nutrient management and elimination of soil disturbance. The strategy of SI is to produce more from less by enhancing the eco-efficiency, reducing waste, and restoring soil health. Whereas CA has been successfully adopted in Brazil, Argentina, Chile and other regions of South America, its potential of harnessing agronomic and ecologic benefits has not been realized in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and elsewhere in The Global South. The strategy of SSC is pertinent because of the ten basic principles or tenets: lack of hierarchy, equal participation in all decision-making processes along with transparency, trust, mutual respect, and accountability. However, several concerns have been raised regarding issues such as land grab, and access to resources etc. Based on the scientific concepts of SI, producing more from less, even a triangular cooperation (TAC) or South-South-North (SSNC) cooperation can be developed to achieve adaptation and mitigation of climate change, advance food security, improve degraded soils and restore soil health through soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, and advance Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the U.N. A widespread adoption of CA and SI through SSC, TAC or SSNC can advance SDGs including #1 (end poverty), #2 (eliminate hunger), #6 (clean water), #13 (climate action), and #15 (life on land). Of the global cropland area under CA estimated at ∼180 million hectare (Mha) in 2015–16, land area under CA is only 2.7 Mha in Africa and 13.2 Mha in Asia.

1640562,The IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme: International initiative to combat climate change,"COP-3 established that nations would act together to combat climate change. Nevertheless, Kyoto was probably just the first step in a long process of addressing this problem. If one accepts the scenarios of IPCC, deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions will be needed if the world is to avoid major change in its climate. Most, but not all, of these emissions arise from use of energy, a commodity which is vital to modern society. To achieve reductions in emissions without affecting standards of living, will require extensive use of new and improved technology, by improvement in energy efficiency, change of fuels, introduction of new energy sources and abatement / sequestration of greenhouse gases. Some of these technologies are widely available now; others are in their infancy. In some cases, despite environmental benefit, the motivation for commercial development or deployment may be slight, since the technology will offer little or no competitive advantage to the user. Also, in the early days of a new energy technology, there may be few opportunities for full-scale investigation, so best use must be made of those which do occur. Many of these constraints on development may apply to the technology for capture and sequestration of CO2 in its current state of development. Such characteristics also make a good case for co-operative action, to improve understanding of the technology options. In view of the nature of the problem, it is especially appropriate that such action be international. The IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme is an international collaborative activity currently supported by 15 countries, the European Commission and 6 industrial sponsors. This Programme evaluates technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fossil fuels, disseminates information and promotes appropriate research, development and demonstration. The IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme has been in operation for 7 years and, in this paper, an overview will be provided of progress in the past 3 years. This has extended previous work on technologies for generation and capture of CO2 from flue gases. Sequestration of CO2 has figured largely in this work, including a series of expert workshops on ocean storage of CO2, an assessment of large-scale sequestration using forestry and formation of practical research projects on geological storage. Studies on methods of producing and using hydrogen from fossil fuels without release of CO2 have demonstrated ways to ease the introduction of hydrogen as an energy carrier. Another important theme has been to put the option of CO2 capture and sequestration in context with other large-scale abatement/mitigation options, such as use of bio-mass for power generation. In addition, a series of studies on abatement of methane emissions from anthropogenic sources has recently been completed. These studies have identified a variety of abatement options, ranging from near-term opportunities which are cost-effective today through to long-term options which might have major impact but would require substantial research and development. Some results from the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme will be illustrated here. Other papers presented at the 4(th) International Conference on Greenhouse Gas control Technologies will provide further information.",,Proceedings Paper,1999.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4453283846378326,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
281302,Geoengineering the climate: History and prospect,"Geoengineering is the intentional large-scale manipulation of the environment, particularly manipulation that is intended to reduce undesired anthropogenic climate change. The post-war rise of climate and weather modification and the history of U.S. assessments of the CO2-climate problem is reviewed. Proposals to engineer the climate are shown to be an integral element of this history. Climate engineering is reviewed with an emphasis on recent developments, including low-mass space-based scattering systems for altering the planetary albedo, simulation of the climate's response to albedo modification, and new findings on iron fertilization in oceanic ecosystems. There is a continuum of human responses to the climate problem that vary in resemblance to hard geoengineering schemes such as space-based mirrors. The distinction between geoengineering and mitigation is therefore fuzzy. A definition is advanced that clarifies the distinction between geoengineering and industrial carbon management. Assessment of geoengineering is reviewed under various framings including economics, risk, politics, and environmental ethics. Finally, arguments are presented for the importance of explicit debate about the implications of countervailing measures such as geoengineering.",climate change; weather modification; mitigation; earth systems engineering; integrated assessment; environmental history,Review,2000.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4430584013462066,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
491529,"Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technological innovation system in China: Structure, function evaluation and policy implication","Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) can be an important technology option for China in addressing global climate change and developing clean energy technologies. Promoted by international climate conventions and supported by government research and development programs, an increasing number of CCS pilot and demonstration projects have been launched in China. In this study, we analyze the structure of China's CCS effort from a technological innovation system (TIS) perspective. Within this system, key socio-political components, including institutions, actor-networks, and technology development, are examined to evaluate the state of the innovation system. The study assessed the perceived capacity of seven functional areas of the CCS innovation system through a survey of key CCS actors and stakeholders. The findings suggest that China's CCS innovation system has a strong functional capacity for knowledge and technology development. It is significantly weaker in the innovative functions of knowledge diffusion, market formation, facilitating entrepreneurs and new entrants into the CCS market. Based on the evaluation of China's technological innovation system to develop CCS, the article articulates specific public policies to formulate a more robust innovation system to traverse the ""valley of death"" from research and development to commercial deployment and accelerate energy innovation in China.

The Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSPs) are the mechanism DOE utilizes to prove the technology and to develop human capital, stakeholder networks, information for regulatory policy, best practices documents and training to work toward the commercialization of carbon capture and storage (CCS). The RCSPs are tasked with determining the most suitable technologies, regulations, and infrastructure for carbon capture, transport, and storage in their respective geographic areas of responsibility. The seven partnerships include more than 400 state agencies, universities, national laboratories, private companies, and environmental organizations, spanning 43 states and four Canadian provinces. The Regional Partnerships Initiative is being implemented in three phases: Characterization, Validation, and Development. The initial Characterization Phase began in 2003 and was completed in 2005 and focused on characterization of CO2 storage potential within each region. It was followed by the Validation Phase, which began in 2005 and is nearing completion in 2011. The focus of the Validation Phase has been on small-scale field tests throughout the seven partnerships in various formation types such as saline, oil-bearing, and coal seams. The Validation Phase has characterized suitable CO2 storage reservoirs and identified the need for comprehensive legal and regulatory frameworks to enable commercial-scale CCS deployment. Finally, the Development Phase will consist of a series of large-scale, one-million-ton, injection tests throughout the United States and Canada. The objective of these large-scale tests is to identify the regulatory path or challenges in permitting CCS projects, to demonstrate the technology can inject CO2 safely, and to verify its permanence in geologic formations in preparation for the commercialization of geologic sequestration.

Durban leaves operations of the GCF undecided, and the international community lacks successful experience to guide interested countries. As a pioneer of China's GCF, the China Green Carbon Foundation (CGCF) is the first nationwide non-profit public foundation dedicated to carbon sequestration, emissions reduction, and addressing climate change. The CGCF is a competent professional organization implementing carbon offsets and carbon neutral projects in China by employing measures such as afforestation projects to sequester carbon and forest protection to reduce carbon emissions. The CGCF has created an integrated public service platform to help enterprises and the public to realize its four main objectives: storing carbon credits, fulfilling social responsibilities, increasing farmers' income, and improving the ecological environment through forestry measures. The CGCF has actively explored ways to innovate its operational model, standard development, project management, carbon trading, scientific research, publicity, and promotion and engages in a novel form of public foundation operations matching enterprise donations for afforestation with corporate social responsibility, carbon credit storage, and voluntary emission reductions. This model has provided a new effective path for businesses and the public to participate in addressing climate change. This paper elaborates on the CGCF innovative practices over the past five years including its operational model, successful projects, and practical experience, and proposes public foundations as important actors in combating climate change.

Infrastructure needs to implement those limits are technologies to remove carbon from electric generation emissions, technologies to dispose of the carbon removed, sensing systems to monitor carbon emissions, and market or regulatory structures to implement the limits.

Increased use of renewable energy can reduce industry carbon emissions. Higher penetrations of intermittent renewable resources, wind and solar, will be allowed if storage is available to allow full dispatch of those generators. Infrastructure needs for energy storage are efficient and cost-competitive technologies to store electricity, power electronic interfaces between those dc technologies and the ac power system, and monitoring and control systems to control and dispatch the storage systems. © 2008 IEEE.",Climate change; Energy storage; Global warming; Infrastructure; Renewable energy; Sustainability; AC generators; Air pollution; Asynchronous machinery; Carbon; Climate change; Climate control; Climatology; Control systems; Customer satisfaction; Electric industry; Electric power systems; Energy conservation; Energy conversion; Energy storage; Flywheels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Modernization; Potential energy; Potential energy surfaces; Power generation; Renewable energy resources; Sensors; Solar energy; Technology; Wind power; 21st century; AC power; Capacity increases; Carbon emissions; Distribution systems; Electric generation; Electrical energy; Electronic interfacing; Industry infrastructure; Infrastructure; Monitoring and control systems; Regulatory structure; Renewable energies; Renewable energy; Renewable resources; Sensing systems; Storage systems; Sustainability; Electric generators,Conference Paper,2008.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4284191429615021,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
1779866,Evaluation of barriers to national CO2 geological storage assessments,"A survey to evaluate the main perceived barriers to national CO2 storage assessments was carried out in 2015, targeting countries where some Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) activity was known or where CCS could potentially be implemented in the future. All the questionnaire respondents indicated that some level of national assessment had been achieved. In most cases, these assessments had been sufficient to allow policy makers to make informed decisions about priorities for follow-up actions. Where national storage assessments had been carried out, the major barriers had been mainly overcome through strong political and regulatory support for CCS and policies enabling access to relevant data.

This pushback is fueled by (i) critical uncertainties about when, where, how, and for whom nature-based solutions are effective and (ii) controversies surrounding their misuse in greenwashing, violations of human rights, and threats to biodiversity. To clarify how the scientific community can help address these issues, I provide an overview of recent research on the benefits and limits of nature-based solutions, including how they compare with technological approaches, and highlight critical areas for future research. © 2022 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Progress of the program relative to the entire State's abandoned mine problems is reviewed. The effects of other reclamation factors, such as natural revegetation, remining, privately-funded reclamation, and secondary carbon recovery, on the overall scope of the State's program are also examined.

290506,Forest protection and tenure status: THE key role of indigenous peoples and protected areas in Panama,"Using recent land cover maps, we used matching techniques to analyze forest cover and assess effectiveness in avoiding deforestation in three main land tenure regimes in Panama, namely protected areas, indigenous territories and non-protected areas. We found that the tenure status of protected areas and indigenous territories (including comarcas and claimed lands) explains a higher rate of success in avoided deforestation than other land tenure categories, when controlling for covariate variables such us distance to roads, distance to towns, slope, and elevation. In 2008 protected areas and indigenous territories had the highest percentage of forest cover and together they hosted 77% of Panama's total mature forest area. Our study shows the promises of matching techniques as a potential tool for demonstrating and quantifying conservation efforts. We therefore propose that matching could be integrated to methodological approaches allowing compensating forests' protectors. Because conserving forest carbon stocks in forested areas of developing countries is an essential component of REDD+ and its future success, the discussion of our results is relevant to countries or jurisdictions with high forest cover and low deforestation rates. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",,JOUR,2014.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4248867630958557,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Responding to this request, we offer the following text in the spirit of reflections that emphasize our personal roles and viewpoints. The primary focus of many of our comments is solar geoengineering and not carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Thus, this text is not intended to comprise a comprehensive review or set of carefully documented analyses. Our primary conclusion is that sustained progress in ""geoengineering"" research will depend on social and material support for experimental work that can provide the observational basis for improved modeling and analysis, and, potentially, development and deployment of systems that may help protect the environment and improve human well-being.

Ecosystem services are the benefits humans derive from ecosystems. The two have been joined to support growing environmental markets with the goal of creating restoration-based credits that can be bought and sold. However, the allure of these markets may be overshadowing shortcomings in the science and practice of ecological restoration. Before making risky investments, we must understand why and when restoration efforts fall short of recovering the full suite of ecosystem services, what can be done to improve restoration success, and why direct measurement of the biophysical processes that support ecosystem services is the only way to guarantee the future success of these markets. Without new science and an oversight framework to protect the ecosystem service assets on which people depend, markets could actually accelerate environmental degradation.",,Review,2009.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4227440655231476,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
292896,'Opening up' geoengineering appraisal: Multi-Criteria Mapping of options for tackling climate change,"Concerted efforts have begun to appraise deliberate, large-scale interventions in the Earth's climate system known as 'geoengineering' in order to provide critical decision support to policy makers around the world. To date geoengineering appraisals have employed narrowly framed inputs (such as context, options, methods and criteria) and 'closed' output reflexivity often amounting to unitary and prescriptive policy recommendations. For the first time, in this paper we begin to address these limitations by 'opening up' appraisal inputs and outputs to a wider diversity of framings, knowledges and future pathways. We use a Multi-Criteria Mapping methodology to appraise carbon and solar geoengineering proposals alongside a range of other options for responding to climate change with a select but diverse group of experts and stakeholders. Overall option rankings are found to vary considerably between participant perspectives and criteria. Despite these differences, the ranks of geoengineering proposals are most often lower than options for mitigating climate change (including voluntary behaviour change and low carbon technologies). The performance of all options is beset by uncertainty, albeit to differing degrees, and it can often be seen that better performing options are outperformed under their pessimistic scores by poorer performing options under their optimistic scores. Several findings contrast with those of other published appraisals. In particular, where stratospheric aerosol injection has previously outperformed other geoengineering options, when assessed against a broader diversity of criteria (spanning all the identified criteria groups) and other options for responding to climate change it performs relatively poorly. We end by briefly exploring the implications of our analysis for geoengineering technologies, their governance, and appraisal. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

2102336,Generating linked technology-socioeconomic scenarios for emerging energy transitions,"The formulation and use of scenarios is now a fundamental part of national and global efforts to assess and plan for climate change. While scenario development initially focused on the technical dimensions of energy, emissions and climate response, in recent years parallel sets of shared socio-economic pathways have been developed to portray the values, motivations, and sociopolitical and institutional dimensions of these systems. However, integrating the technical and social aspects of evolving energy systems is difficult, with transitions dependent on highly uncertain technological advances, social preferences, political governance, climate urgency, and the interaction of these elements to maintain or overcome systemic inertia. A broad range of interdisciplinary knowledge is needed to structure and evaluate these processes, many of which involve a mix of qualitative and quantitative factors. To structure and facilitate the necessary linkages this paper presents an approach for generating a plausible range of scenarios for an emerging energy technology. The method considers influences among technical and social factors that can encourage or impede necessary improvements in the performance and cost of the technology, as well the processes affecting public acceptance and the establishment of governance structures necessary to support effective planning and implementation. A Bayesian network is used to capture relationships among the technological and socioeconomic factors likely to affect the probability that the technology will achieve significant penetration and adoption. The method is demonstrated for carbon capture and storage (CCS): a potential technology on the pathway to deep decarbonization. A preliminary set of expert elicitations is conducted to illustrate how relationships between these factors can be estimated. This establishes a prior or baseline network that can be subsequently analyzed by choosing either optimistic or pessimistic assumptions for respective groups of technical and social variables, identifying sets of key factors that limit or encourage successful deployment.",Energy system transitions; Decarbonisation; Carbon capture and storage (CCS); Bayesian Belief Network (BBN); Expert judgment; Scenario generation,Article,2019.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4210894107818603,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0
113459,Assessing relative importance and mutual influence of barriers for CCS deployment of the ROAD project using AHP and DEMATEL methods,"Several carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects around the world were cancelled, delayed or are on hold due to different types of barriers, such as: economic, legal, social and technical. Previous works treat these barriers as independent factors, ignoring potential interactions and possibly providing wrong information. This paper presents the findings of a survey in which experts evaluate the main barriers hampering the deployment of the ROAD project, in the Netherlands. Using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) methods, we have concluded that (i) CCS barriers are highly interconnected; (ii) ""CO2 price"" and ""financial incentives"" are the most important barriers and should be priorities for investments; (iii) ""CO2 price"" highly influences other barriers; (iv) ""financial incentives"" is very much influenced by them; (v) policy recommendations should take into consideration how these barriers influence each other. Our study recommends caution to policymakers using the results from previous works, once that they may not reproduce correctly the ranking of the barriers, which may lead to incorrect analysis and conclusions.

2287,Opportunities and challenges for mangrove carbon sequestration in the Mekong River Delta in Vietnam,"Increasing value is attributed to mangroves due to their considerable capacity to sequester carbon, known as 'blue carbon'. Assessments of opportunities and challenges associated with estimating the significance of carbon sequestered by mangroves need to consider a range of disciplinary perspectives, including the bio-physical science mangroves, social and economic issues of land use, local and international law, and the role of public and private finance. We undertook an interdisciplinary review based on available literature and fieldwork focused on parts of the Mekong River Delta (MRD). Preliminary estimates indicate mangrove biomass may be 70-150 t ha(-1), but considerably larger storage of carbon occurs in sediments beneath mangroves. These natural stores of carbon are compromised when mangroves are removed to accommodate anthropogenic activities. Mangroves are an important resource in the MRD that supplies multiple goods and services, and conservation or re-establishment of mangroves provides many benefits. International law and within-country environmental frameworks offer increasing scope to recognize the role that mangrove forests play through carbon sequestration, in order that these might lead to funding opportunities, both in public and private sectors. Such schemes need to have positive rather than negative impacts on the livelihoods of the many people living within and adjacent to these wetlands. Nevertheless, many challenges remain and it will require further targeted and coordinated scientific research, development of economic and social incentives to protect and restore mangroves, supportive law and policy mechanisms at global and national levels, and establishment of long-term financing for such endeavours.",Mangroves; Blue carbon; Sequestration; Mekong River delta; Vietnam,Article,2016.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4194118678569793,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5336627,Atmospheric methane removal: A research agenda,"Atmospheric methane removal (e.g. in situ methane oxidation to carbon dioxide) may be needed to offset continued methane release and limit the global warming contribution of this potent greenhouse gas. Because mitigating most anthropogenic emissions of methane is uncertain this century, and sudden methane releases from the Arctic or elsewhere cannot be excluded, technologies for methane removal or oxidation may be required. Carbon dioxide removal has an increasingly well-established research agenda and technological foundation. No similar framework exists for methane removal. We believe that a research agenda for negative methane emissions - 'removal' or atmospheric methane oxidation - is needed. We outline some considerations for such an agenda here, including a proposed Methane Removal Model Intercomparison Project (MR-MIP).

3960442,Negative emissions and the long history of carbon removal,"Recent IPCC assessments highlight a key role for large-scale carbon removal in meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement. This focus on removal, also referred to as negative emissions, is suggestive of novel opportunities, risks, and challenges in addressing climate change, but tends to build on the narrow techno-economic framings that characterize integrated assessment modeling. While the discussion on negative emissions bears important parallels to a wider and older literature on carbon sequestration and carbon sinks, this earlier scholarship-particularly from the critical social sciences-is seldom engaged with by the negative emissions research community. In this article, we survey this ""long history"" of carbon removal and seek to draw out lessons for ongoing research and the emerging public debate on negative emissions. We argue that research and policy on negative emissions should proceed not just from projections of the future, but also from an acknowledgement of past controversies, successes and failures. In particular, our review calls attention to the irreducibly political character of carbon removal imaginaries and accounting practices and urges acknowledgement of past experiences with the implementation of (small-scale) carbon sequestration projects. Our review in this way highlights the importance of seeing continuity in the carbon removal discussion and calls for more engagement with existing social science scholarship on the subject. Acknowledging continuity and embracing an interdisciplinary research agenda on carbon removal are important aspects in making climate change mitigation research more responsible, and a precondition to avoid repeating past mistakes and failures.

Overall, anthropogenic CO2 emissions are estimated to range around 24 billion ton/yr, while industrial use of CO2 is estimated at 115 million ton/yr. With the implementation of CCS, CO2 from concentrated waste streams becomes available in increasing quantities for potential use as raw material or industrial gas for chemical processes. CO2 utilization is not a competing alternative to CCS. In contrast, its use as a C1 building block in chemical synthesis complements CCS in our arsenal of measures for a sustainable carbon recovery. Whereas the motivation for CCS lies essentially in removing CO2 from the emissions, the chemical use focuses on the generation of value-added products and improved processes.",,JOUR,2009.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.409954696893692,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
2510576,Anthropogenic climate change and countermeasures: Chances and risks of weather modification techniques and climate engineering (CE),"There are different measures to tackle the challenge of Climate Change. This includes weather modification techniques and climate engineering (CE). Especially the application of CE is very controversial. In this connection, one has to differentiate between carbon dioxide removal (CDR) techniques and solar radiation management (SRM) techniques. According to climate experts, CDR techniques - except from the controversial CO2 sequestration and some other risky CDR techniques - interfere less aggressively into the natural environment than SRM techniques. Additionally, CDR puts on the causes of Climate Change, whereas SRM merely treats the symptoms. Apart from possible negative side effects, environmental modification techniques and CE might also be abused and have already been abused for covert weather warfare or terrorism by the deliberate aggravation or creation of extreme weather patterns and natural disasters like droughts, blizzards, floods, and storms with the intention to cause property damages, health problems, injuries, or even fatalities in certain areas or nations to harm the enemy. Although weather and climate modification for military or other hostile purposes are expressly prohibited by the UN's 1977 ENMOD Convention, this UN convention is repeatedly circumvented. In fact - additionally to the inadvertent anthropogenic climate change - deliberate anthropogenic Climate Change seems to be feasible nowadays by the use of existing technology, allowing a range of possibilities for targeted large-scale anthropogenic modification and manipulation of the weather and possibly even the climate. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.",,Book Chapter,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4089233577251434,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

5336714,Should carbon removal be treated as waste management? Lessons from the cultural history of waste: Carbon removal as waste management,"Carbon dioxide is a waste product of combusting fossil fuels, and its accumulation in the atmosphere presents a planetary hazard. Carbon dioxide is also managed and used as a resource. Emerging technologies like direct air capture present the opportunity to reclaim and re-use wasted carbon, and actors in industry and policy are increasingly understanding carbon capture, utilization and storage as a waste management process. What is the value, and the danger, of conceptualizing CO 2 as a waste to be managed? This paper looks at the historical evolution of solid and liquid waste regimes to draw lessons for the future evolution of a gaseous waste regime. It finds that social decisions to clean up solid and liquid waste were driven by both culture and industry. Views of recycling and sanitation did not evolve smoothly, with recycling falling in and out of favour, and sanitation experiencing conflict between public and private actors. An earlier attempt to revalue waste as part of a circular economy-the 1930s scientific and industrial field of chemurgy-failed to become a durable term and movement. These experiences hold important takeaways for negative emissions technologies and carbon removal policy: Technocratic ideas about resource management may not take hold without a broader popular movement, as in the case of chemurgy, but value change and technology development can support each other, as in the case of wastewater infrastructure. Scientists and carbon removal policy advocates have an opportunity to contextualize CO 2 waste management within the struggles and goals of the larger circular economy project, and to focus simultaneously on both waste production and waste disposal. © 2020 The Authors.",,Review,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4060584008693695,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

(2017) Nature Ecology and Evolution, 1420; TNC (2017) Caribbean: A revolution to save coral reefs in the Caribbean and beyond). In Australia, there is increasing interest and investment in coastal restoration and habitat conservation, particularly with respect to growing national concerns around habitat loss, coastal inundation and erosion, loss of fisheries and climate change (Maggini et al. (2013) Protecting and restoring habitat to help Australia's threatened, species adapt to climate change; GBRMPA (2017) Reef summit sets new course of action for the Great Barrier Reef). This has led to new community of practices being formed for shellfish reef restoration (Shellfish Reef Restoration Network shellfishrestoration.org.au), seagrass restoration (Seagrass Restoration Network seagrassrestoration.net), and saltmarsh and mangrove (Saltmarsh and Mangrove Network, amsn.net.au) conservation. However, despite this interest, there has been no national coordination, network or society with coastal restoration as a primary focus. The inaugural Australian Coastal Restoration Symposium brought together 60 Australian restoration practitioners, researchers and managers at James Cook University, Townsville for three days from the 31st of August 2017.

Funding for REDD+ projects has increased in recent years and REDD+ projects have proliferated, but relatively few studies have, as yet, examined their implementation. Here, we present a synthesis of the challenges and lessons learned while implementing a REDD+ project in an Embera community in Panama. Our case study, documented in four cycles of collaborative action research over 11 years, examines how local communities sought to reduce emissions from deforestation and benefit from carbon offset trading while improving local livelihoods. Through semi-structured interviews and participatory methods, we found that success with REDD+ hinges on broader issues than those widely discussed in the literature and in policy circles. Though economic incentives for participants and the equitable distribution of benefits remain important to project participants, our study finds that, in adapting REDD+ strategies to best suit community needs, the role of a support system for implementation (""bridging institutions"") and REDD+'s potential as a conflict resolution mechanism for tenure issues deserve more attention as key factors that contribute to meaningful participation in REDD+.",REDD; community REDD; carbon-offset projects; land tenure; deforestation; climate change mitigation,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.4017243683338165,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
1002774,"From Problems to Potentials-The Urban Energy Transition of Gruz, Dubrovnik","In the challenge for a sustainable society, carbon-neutrality is a critical objective for all cities in the coming decades. In the EU City-zen project, academic partners collaborate to develop an urban energy transition methodology, which supports cities in making the energy transition to sustainable lifestyles and carbon neutrality. As part of the project, so-called Roadshows are organised in cities that wish to take the first step toward zero-energy living. Each Roadshow is methodologically composed to allow sustainability experts from across Europe to co-create designs, strategies and timelines with local stakeholders in order to reach this vital goal. Following a precursory investigative student workshop (the SWAT Studio), Dubrovnik was the third city to host the Roadshow in November 2016. During these events the characteristics of Dubrovnik, and the district of Gruz in particular, were systematically analysed, leading to useful insights into the current problems and potentials of the city. In close collaboration with local stakeholders, the team proposed a series of interventions, validated by the calculation of carbon emission, to help make Gruz, and in its wake the whole city of Dubrovnik, net zero energy and zero carbon.

666789,Compensation for ecosystem services: an evaluation of efforts to achieve conservation and development in Ecuadorian paramo grasslands,"Ecosystem services programmes have been advocated for their potential to join conservation and poverty alleviation efforts, integrate working landscapes, and provide a flow of ecosystem services upon which populations rely. Ecuadorian paramo grasslands have rapidly become the focus of compensation for ecosystem services (CES) programmes intended to conserve hydrologic services, carbon sequestration and biodiversity. This paper reviews CES programmes in Ecuadorian paramos using a combination of semi-structured interviews with project personnel, policy makers and community leaders involved in CES programme development, document analysis, and archival research. Findings indicate that, in some cases, CES schemes can support local development, with potential to contribute to poverty alleviation; however, measures of programme effects on poverty were lacking. The programmes fell across the spectrum of activity-reducing to activity-enhancing, with some functioning as protected areas and others integrating working landscapes; however, designation of land as protected did not necessarily imply more restrictive use. Finally, these cases all reflect scenarios in which limited information is available linking land use with ecosystem services production and underscore the idea that adequate understanding of ecosystem production functions continues to be a barrier to development of effective programmes, particularly where the provision of multiple ecosystem services is anticipated.",Andes; biodiversity; carbon; conservation; Ecuador; paramo grasslands; payment for ecosystem services; water,Article,2011.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3996024131774902,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

These agricultural practices can potentially both contribute to climate change mitigation and increase the soil's resilience to physical and biological stresses. The paper draws on research findings from five regions across Europe to identify regionally-specific barriers to and opportunities for the adoption of soil carbon management practices. Data were derived from 50 interviews with policy-makers and advisers and 5 stakeholder workshops in Denmark, Italy, Hungary, Poland and Spain. Several barriers to the uptake of soil carbon management practices were common across all regions, however, regional variations were also identified highlighting the importance of understanding the context into which these practices are introduced. Key barriers related to existing biophysical conditions, lack of financial support, farmer knowledge and experience, and the quality of the advisory service. Opportunities included providing economic incentives, harmonizing regulation, supporting long term thinking and planning for resilience and providing good quality advice. We conclude that in addition to persuasive mechanisms for encouraging the adoption of these practices, what is required is a more process-oriented approach that focuses on a series of experiential changes and fosters farmer learning through interactive models of communicative intervention.",Soil carbon management; barriers; opportunities; sustainable agriculture; climate change mitigation,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3979527652263641,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

One means to prevent climate change is to reduce the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This can be achieved using CO2 capture and storage (CCS) technology. Due to the relative novelty of the technology, low level of experience, and high risk of implementation, in practice society often displays a negative attitude towards CCS projects. Thus, it is necessary to develop a targeted strategy to popularize CO2 capture and storage technology. Based on an extensive literature review and the experience of implementation of CCS projects in different countries, this study demonstrates the necessity of applying the deficit, contextual, lay expertise, and public participation models to promote CCS technology. As a result, the factors influencing the choice of promotion tools are identified, and the measures to popularize CCS technology, depending on the stage of its implementation, are determined. Recommendations for the improvement of CCS public databases are developed.

When Is Carbon Dioxide?,"In this article, I focus on carbon capture and storage (CCS), a controversial climate change mitigation technology that operates by collecting carbon dioxide from point sources and depositing it in underground locations, such as depleting oil reservoirs. Specifically, I investigate the ways in which certain CCS professionals imagine and demand a reconceptualization of carbon dioxide: not as waste or as dangerous material that should be taxed and exchanged in carbon markets, but as a neutral gas that can be bought and sold as a commodity, and perhaps used as a drilling additive for the oil and gas industry. CCS professionals suggest that carbon dioxide has multiple legal, political, and chemical meanings and existences across different points on a CCS network, and they acknowledge how this condition makes it difficult to produce the molecule as a commodity characterized by exchange and commensurability. In studying the commodification of carbon dioxide, I show how these professionals do not intend to create ""sameness"" across the market, but instead wish to commodify the molecule through ""linking"" various versions of carbon dioxide together. By tracking carbon dioxide as it moves within a CCS network, I explore the moral logics of CCS technologies, which obscure how energy-intensive models of life triggered climate change in the first place.",,Article,2016.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3940925300121307,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

While many projects essential to commercializing the technology have been proposed, most (>80%) end in failure. Here we analyze the full universe of CCS projects attempted in the U.S. that have sufficient documentation (N=39)-the largest sample ever studied systematically. We quantify 12 project attributes that the literature has identified as possible determinants of project outcome. In addition to costs and technological readiness, which prior research has emphasized, we develop metrics for attributes that are widely thought to be important yet have eluded systematic measurement, such as the credibility of project revenues and policy incentives, and the role of regulatory complexity and public opposition. We build three models-two statistical and one derived through the elicitation of expert judgment-to evaluate the relative influence of these 12 attributes in explaining project outcome. Across models, we find the credibility of revenues and incentives to be among the most important attributes, along with capital cost and technological readiness. We therefore develop and elicit experts' judgment of 14 types of policy incentives that could alter these attributes and improve the prospects for investment in CCS. Knowing which attributes have been most responsible for past successes and failures allows developers to avoid past mistakes and identify clusters of near-term CCS projects that are more likely to succeed.",carbon capture and storage; decarbonization; political economy; preference elicitation; statistical learning,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3940621018409729,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3875967,"How Incumbent Cultural and Cognitive Path Dependencies Constrain the ""Scenario Cone"": Reliance on Carbon Dioxide Removal due to Techno-bias","Scenario analysis is widely used to assess long-term development necessary to reach climate targets. Mitigation measures in these scenarios concentrate on supply-side technology solutions, while little attention has been paid to demand side solutions. One suite of included technologies are carbon dioxide removal technologies (CDR). Most scenarios rely heavily on CDR to limit global warming to 1.5-2 degrees C. Yet, the reliance on CDR is highly controversial, as most CDR technologies remain unproven to date and dramatic adverse side effects seem likely. Using an interdisciplinary approach, we assess why the selection of prominently represented scenarios is narrowed down on such a confined, CDR dependent scenario cone. After critically assessing CDR, based on existing techno-economic literature, we perform a theoretical analysis of the underlying scientific processes and then transfer the resulting insights into the process of scenario development. We base our analysis on various approaches of feminist theory. These approaches allow a reflection and critique of common scientific practice as well as a contextualization of underlying values and norms. We argue that the focus on technological solutions is not an outcome of an open scientific competition of ideas, but due to underlying assumptions based on thought patterns prevalent in western societies. Thus, to provide the chance of a more open and objective debate about possible climate change mitigation measures and pathways we need to reconsider underlying assumptions and biases influencing the scenario building process.",Scenario analysis; Demand side; Climate change mitigation; Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR); Techno-bias; Feminist theory; Path dependency,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3936752676963806,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

This paper provides an analysis and synthesis of the funding strategies, methods and approaches that have been applied and tested under the Partnership to pilot and scale up IEM and sustainable land management (SLM) practices in the western People's Republic of China under its first 10years. On the basis of a mix of methods using literature reviews, data collection at selected pilot sites through household questionnaire surveys, stakeholder workshops and field sampling, the following lessons were generated: (i) mainstreaming of IEM into relevant policy and development frameworks has been the most effective way of mobilizing funding for scaling up of SLM; (ii) SLM best practices need to be combined with economic incentives for land users, and pilot demonstrations of SLM need to be integrated into larger investment programmes to achieve impacts and economies of scale; (iii) market-based approaches to scaling up of SLM, such as payment for ecosystem services and public-private partnerships, have a role to play, but cost-benefit analysis need to be better integrated into payment schemes; (iv) the economic benefits of carbon sequestration are too low to fund eco-compensation schemes on their own but can provide supplementary funding; and (v) land degradation and SLM monitoring and assessment systems should be multiscale to support decision-making on SLM and to monitor impact from the local to the national level.

4374928,"Mapping feasibilities of greenhouse gas removal: Key issues, gaps and opening up assessments","Greenhouse gas removal technologies and practices are essential to bring emissions to net zero and limit global warming to 1.5 degrees C. To achieve this, the majority of integrated assessment models (IAMs), that generate future emissions scenarios and inform the international policy process, use large-scale afforestation and biomass energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). The feasibility of these technologies and practices has only so far been considered from a relatively narrow techno-economic or biophysical perspective. Here, we present one of the first studies to elicit perspectives through an expert mapping process to open up and broaden the discussion around feasibility of afforestation and BECCS. Our stakeholders included business and industry, non-governmental organisations and policy makers, spanning expertise in bioenergy, forestry, CCS and climate change. Perspectives were elicited on (1) issues relating to BECCS with large-scale afforestation, and (2) specific criteria for assessing feasibility. Participants identified 12 main themes with 61 sub-themes around issues, and 11 main themes with 33 sub-themes around feasibility criteria. Our findings show important societal and governance aspects of feasibility that are currently under-represented, specifically issues around real-world complexity, competing human needs, justice and ethics. Unique to the use of these technologies for greenhouse gas removal are issues around temporal and spatial scale, and greenhouse gas accounting. Using these expert insights, we highlight where IAMs currently poorly capture these concerns. These broader, often more qualitative perspectives, issues and uncertainties must be recognised and accounted for, in order to understand the real-world feasibility of large-scale afforestation and BECCS and the role they play in limiting climate change. These considerations enable widening the scope to broader and deeper discussions about possible and desirable futures, beyond a focus on achieving net-zero emissions, attentive to the effects such decisions may have. We outline approaches that can be used to attend to the complex social and political dimensions that IAMs do not render. By complementing IAMs in this way opportunities can be created to open up considerations of future options and alternatives beyond those framings proposed by IAMs, creating opportunities for inclusion of knowledges, reflexivity and responsibility.",Greenhouse gas removal; Negative emissions; Carbon dioxide removal; BECCS; Afforestation; Expert elicitation,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3860395550727844,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
894650,A conceptual framework for ecosystem restoration applied to industrial peatlands,"Introduction The extraction of peat for fuel on an industrial basis started in the seventeenth century in eastern and northern Europe as the supply of wood for energy declined. The use of peat for energy in North America has always been small in scale. The demand for horticultural peat rose steadily after World War II on both continents (http://peatmoss.com/what-is-peat-moss/the-history-of-peat/). Currently, Europe and North America use peatmoss-peat extensively for landscaping, professional greenhouse production, hydrocarbon spills and waste water treatment. To date, in Canada, the main horticultural peat producers have impacted close to 20 000 ha. To place this into context, Canada’s peatland extent is estimated to be around 125 000 000 ha with industrial activities mostly located on the southern margins of the peatland distribution. Most of the industrial peatlands are still in operation (16 000 ha), whereas close to 2000 ha have been restored according to the approach described below. With the rising awareness of goods and services provided by wetlands in the 1980-90s (Costanza et al. 1997), the international industrial peat sector recognised the impacts their activities had on peatland functions and developed a strategy for responsible peatland management. Several countries have since developed their own strategy and encourage the restoration of industrial peatlands (Clarke and Rieley 2010). For the case of Canada, peatland restoration is particularly driven by their main US horticultural clients, who demand responsible management of wetlands, driven by their interior policy on wetlands (NAWCA 1989). Based on two decades of trial-and-error experiments on restoring industrial peatlands, we have created a restoration framework. This framework draws on the ideas of assembly rules and restoration ecology. In this chapter, the framework is applied to restoring peatlands, but it should be applicable to the restoration of any ecosystem. Assembly rules and restoration ecology The union of assembly rules and restoration ecology should be beneficial for both areas of ecology (Keddy 1999; Temperton et al. 2004). Assembly rules are a helpful tool for restoration because, if the constraints of community membership are defined, restoration efforts can focus on manipulating these constraints to steer succession towards the desired community (Temperton et al. 2004). Restoration ecology has been criticised for being a haphazard collection of individual cases (Keddy 1999). © British Ecological Society 2016.",,Book Chapter,2016.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3846063017845154,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
652309,"International collaboration on capture, storage and utilisation of greenhouse gases","Climate change will have world-wide implications. So it is highly appropriate that there should be international collaboration to investigate technologies for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases, the root cause of the problem. Sixteen countries, as well as three industrial sponsors, support the IEA Greenhouse Gas R and D Programme and, in many cases, industry is also involved indirectly, through the national memberships. This provides a broad range of interest and expertise to guide the management of the Programme, as well as ensuring that the results reach a wide audience. The IEA Greenhouse Gas R and D Programme has three main activities: (1) evaluation of technologies for mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions from use of fossil fuels; (2) dissemination of the results of these studies; (3) identification of targets for research, development and demonstration and promotion of these findings. In its first five years of operation, the Programme has studied the major greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide and methane, and various means of of reducing their emissions. The main emphasis has been placed on capture, storage and utilisation of CO2 from power generation. This option is now much better understood and can be compared with more established measures, such as fuel switching, energy efficiency improvements and use of renewable energy. As well as studying abatement of CO2 emissions, the Programme has conducted a series of studies of technologies for reducing CH4 emissions from man-made sources. The Programme's activities are carried out by the Operating Agent, who develops and manages a series of technical studies to meet members' requirements. These studies are carried out by expert contractors, selected by competitive tendering. By these means, the members of the Programme gain access to valuable and topical information at moderate cost. The Programme has so far carried out about 40 separate evaluation studies. These have highlighted some key questions, which must be answered in order to enable application of CO2 sequestration techniques. For example, important issues concern the prediction of the performance and environmental impact of CO2 storage. To improve knowledge of such matters will involve practical investigations.

116285,Rethinking climate engineering categorization in the context of climate change mitigation and adaptation,"The portfolio of approaches to respond to the challenges posed by anthropogenic climate change has broadened beyond mitigation and adaptation with the recent discussion of potential climate engineering options. How to define and categorize climate engineering options has been a recurring issue in both public and specialist discussions. We assert here that current definitions of mitigation, adaptation, and climate engineering are ambiguous, overlap with each other and thus contribute to confusing the discourse on how to tackle anthropogenic climate change. We propose a new and more inclusive categorization into five different classes: anthropogenic emissions reductions (AER), territorial or domestic removal of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases (D-GGR), trans-territorial removal of atmospheric CO2 and other greenhouse gases (T-GGR), regional to planetary targeted climate modification (TCM), and climate change adaptation measures (including local targeted climate and environmental modification, abbreviated CCAM). Thus, we suggest that techniques for domestic greenhouse gas removal might better be thought of as forming a separate category alongside more traditional mitigation techniques that consist of emissions reductions. Local targeted climate modification can be seen as an adaptation measure as long as there are no detectable remote environmental effects. In both cases, the scale and intensity of action are essential attributes from the technological, climatic, and political viewpoints. While some of the boundaries in this revised classification depend on policy and judgement, it offers a foundation for debating on how to define and categorize climate engineering options and differentiate them from both mitigation and adaptation measures to climate change.

165766,"Challenges of community-forestry based carbon projects: Process, participation, performance","This paper addresses the challenges in community-based management of carbon projects in developing countries. It is based on four years of experience in identifying, developing, implementing, and monitoring mangrove restoration and agroforestry projects in upland and coastal areas of India, Indonesia, and Senegal. While many of the challenges are common to any typical grass-roots development project, we focus on aspects that are more directly related to carbon sequestration activities. To address all of these challenges, the paper proposes some measures that we believe help make implementation and monitoring easier for practitioners in this realm. Our thematic focus of ""process"", ""participation"" and ""performance"" underscores three key areas we believe merit greater attention in these projects. The process elements are important because of specialized knowledge that is often not familiar to communities such as the process of identifying suitable planting sites and arrangements, and suitable implementation arrangements given stakeholder needs requires significant upfront commitment from all involved. The challenges related to process are highlighted through reference to methodology selection, and the implications it has for site selection through to implementation. The second theme - participation - addresses the peculiar stakeholder interests, interactions and arrangements that arise at all stages of the project. A challenge is meeting all stakeholder expectations and constraints through recognizing that people have different motivations and interests; as examples, active engagement is necessary to find acceptable terms for implementation, revenue sharing, and risk sharing. Again, peculiarities of the carbon market - such as carbon property rights - often create uncertainty that must be handled delicately in such circumstances. The final theme - performance - relates to an ongoing need to accommodate a complex array of monitoring, auditing, validation and quality control requirements over a range of multiple objectives. The challenge in this realm is to implement high-scale projects that are economically viable, but which will stretch the capacity of local community-based systems considering compliance requirements with regards to implementation and carbon accounting standards. Hence the interests and requirements of different stakeholders may not be fully aligned. As an example, many carbon projects now have multiple objectives - carbon, biodiversity, and community welfare - but there are few received protocols for addressing these concurrently. An important insight through all of these dimensions is that no single concept of ""community"" can be universally applied: the connections among stakeholders and others are never as clear as one assumes them to be. © Author(s) 2012.",Agroforestry; Carbon methodology; High scale implementation; Mangrove; Monitoring,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3795128166675567,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
4382461,Perspective: Increasing blue carbon around Antarctica is an ecosystem service of considerable societal and economic value worth protecting,"Precautionary conservation and cooperative global governance are needed to protect Antarctic blue carbon: the world's largest increasing natural form of carbon storage with high sequestration potential. As patterns of ice loss around Antarctica become more uniform, there is an underlying increase in carbon capture-to-storage-to-sequestration on the seafloor. The amount of carbon captured per unit area is increasing and the area available to blue carbon is also increasing. Carbon sequestration could further increase under moderate (+1 degrees C) ocean warming, contrary to decreasing global blue carbon stocks elsewhere. For example, in warmer waters, mangroves and seagrasses are in decline and benthic organisms are close to their physiological limits, so a 1 degrees C increase in water temperature could push them above their thermal tolerance (e.g. bleaching of coral reefs). In contrast, on the basis of past change and current research, we expect that Antarctic blue carbon could increase by orders of magnitude. The Antarctic seafloor is biophysically unique and the site of carbon sequestration, the benthos, faces less anthropogenic disturbance than any other ocean continental shelf environment. This isolation imparts both vulnerability to change, and an avenue to conserve one of the world's last biodiversity refuges. In economic terms, the value of Antarctic blue carbon is estimated at between 0.65 pound and 1.76 pound billion (similar to 2.27 billion USD) for sequestered carbon in the benthos around the continental shelf. To balance biodiversity protection against society's economic objectives, this paper builds on a proposal incentivising protection by building a 'non-market framework' via the 2015 Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. This could be connected and coordinated through the Antarctic Treaty System to promote and motivate member states to value Antarctic blue carbon and maintain scientific integrity and conservation for the positive societal values ingrained in the Antarctic Treaty System.",Antarctic Treaty System; biodiversity conservation; blue carbon; carbon sequestration,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3790605962276459,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

These mitigation approaches to climate change present an opportunity to supplement energy sector decarbonization and provide co-benefits in terms of ecosystem services and landscape productivity. The biological engineering profession must be involved in the research and implementation of these solutions—developing new tools to aid in decision-making, methods to optimize across different objectives, and new messaging frameworks to assist in prioritizing among different options. Furthermore, the biological engineering curriculum should be redesigned to reflect the needs of carbon-based landscape management. While doing so, the biological engineering community has an opportunity to embed justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion within both the classroom and the profession. Together these transformations will enhance our capacity to use sustainable landscape management as an active tool to mitigate the risks of climate change. © 2022, The Author(s).",,Review,2022.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3737687468528747,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5298344,Social Factors Key to Landscape-Scale Coastal Restoration: Lessons Learned from Three US Case Studies,"In the United States, extensive investments have been made to restore the ecological function and services of coastal marine habitats. Despite a growing body of science supporting coastal restoration, few studies have addressed the suite of societally enabling conditions that helped facilitate successful restoration and recovery efforts that occurred at meaningful ecological (i.e., ecosystem) scales, and where restoration efforts were sustained for longer (i.e., several years to decades) periods. Here, we examined three case studies involving large-scale and long-term restoration efforts including the seagrass restoration effort in Tampa Bay, Florida, the oyster restoration effort in the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia, and the tidal marsh restoration effort in San Francisco Bay, California. The ecological systems and the specifics of the ecological restoration were not the focus of our study. Rather, we focused on the underlying social and political contexts of each case study and found common themes of the factors of restoration which appear to be important for maintaining support for large-scale restoration efforts. Four critical elements for sustaining public and/or political support for large-scale restoration include: (1) resources should be invested in building public support prior to significant investments into ecological restoration; (2) building political support provides a level of significance to the recovery planning efforts and creates motivation to set and achieve meaningful recovery goals; (3) recovery plans need to be science-based with clear, measurable goals that resonate with the public; and (4) the accountability of progress toward reaching goals needs to be communicated frequently and in a way that the general public comprehends. These conclusions may help other communities move away from repetitive, single, and seemingly unconnected restoration projects towards more large-scale, bigger impact, and coordinated restoration efforts.",coastal restoration; oyster; marsh; seagrass; restoration success; coastal habitat,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.37302365899086,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0

The literature distinguishes between two broad types of climate engineering: solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal. We review the science and engineering characteristics of these technologies and analyze the implications of those characteristics for economic policy design. We discuss optimal policy and carbon price, interregional and intergenerational equity issues, strategic interaction in the design of international environmental agreements, and the sources of risk and uncertainty surrounding these technologies. We conclude that climate engineering technologies, similar to mitigation and adaptation, should be a fundamental part of future domestic and global climate policy design.

2514590,An AHP Assessment Of Barriers in Adopting Sustainable Forest Management Practices in The Context Of Carbon Emission Reductions in Cameroon,"As the role of forests in climate change mitigation is explicitly recognized in the Paris Agreement, the need to enhance the adoption of Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) practices is crucial. Therefore, this paper aims at identifying and evaluating barriers in adopting SFM practices in the context of forest carbon emission reductions. A total of 15 barriers in adopting SFM practices are listed through literature and expert inputs. Using Cameroon as a case study, the listed barriers are then evaluated by experts to determine their relative importance using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. According to our findings, the ‘Regulatory and Legislative frameworks’ barrier category was attributed to the highest importance among other categories, in adopting SFM practices in the forestry sector. ‘Inadequate political will and incentive to enforce regulations’ appears to be the major obstacle in adopting SFM practices in Cameroon. As carbon emission reduction initiatives are being developed, there is need to move from broad to concrete suggestions that will overcome these barriers. However, proper diagnosis is necessary in order to target barriers with the right incentives and enabling conditions that will support carbon programs and projects to deliver effective emission reductions. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.",,Article,,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3664859235286712,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

However, the support for IPLCs to continue managing their land is either completely absent or scanty. This paper presents the value of only four ecosystem services, estimated at USD 1.16 trillion per year, that are delivered from IPLCs managed lands alone (excluding coastal, marine, and other resources). These four ecosystem services (ES), i.e., carbon sequestration, biocontrol, air, and water regulation offer offsite benefits to the wider regional and global populations yet without returns to the IPLCs themselves except for facing more climate and natural disaster-related challenges mainly caused by the actions of mainstream society. It further outlines key challenges and advocates for establishing stewardship mechanisms to promote and support IPLCs land management practices that will effectively help in protecting and preserving biodiversity, water, and other natural resources on Earth to sustain and enhance human well-being. © 2020 by the author.",,Article,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3663928508758545,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
683479,Managing carbon in a multiple use world: The implications of land-use decision context for carbon management,"Human land use contributes significantly to the growth of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Changes in land management practices have been proposed as a critical and cost-effective mechanism for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting the storage of additional carbon in vegetation and soils. However many discussions of the potential for land use to mitigate climate change only take into account biophysical factors such as vegetation and land cover and neglect how the agency of land owners themselves affects whether additional carbon storage can be achieved. Unlike many potential REDD opportunities in developing countries, land management in the U.S. to enhance carbon sequestration would occur against a backdrop of clearly defined, legally enforceable land ownership. In addition, more than a third of the land surface in the U.S. is managed by federal agencies who operate under legal guidelines for multiple use and is subject to demands from multiple constituencies. We set out to investigate how the goal of enhancing carbon sequestration through land use is perceived or implemented in one region of the U.S., and how this goal might intersect the existing drivers and incentives for public and private land use decision making. We conducted a case study through interviews of the major categories of landowners in the state of Colorado, which represents a mixture of public and privately held lands. By analyzing trends in interview responses across categories, we found that managing for carbon is currently a fairly low priority and we identify several barriers to more widespread consideration of carbon as a management priority including competing objectives, limited resources, lack of information, negative perceptions of offsetting and lack of a sufficient policy signal. We suggest four avenues for enhancing the potential for carbon to be managed through land use including clarifying mandates for public lands, providing compelling incentives for private landowners, improving understanding of the co-benefits and tradeoffs of managing for carbon, and creating more usable science to support decision making.

4379882,Modelling net-zero emissions energy systems requires a change in approach,"Energy modelling can assist national decision makers in determining strategies that achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, three key challenges for the modelling community are emerging under this radical climate target that needs to be recognized and addressed. A first challenge is the need to represent new mitigation options not currently represented in many energy models. We emphasize here the under representation of end-use sector demand-side options due to the traditional supply side focus of many energy models, along with issues surrounding robustness in deploying carbon dioxide removal (CDR) options. A second challenge concerns the types of models used. We highlight doubts about whether current models provide sufficient relevant insights on system feasibility, actor behaviour, and policy effectiveness. A third challenge concerns how models are applied for policy analyses. Priorities include the need for expanding scenario thinking to incorporate a wider range of uncertainty factors, providing insights on target setting, alignment with broader policy objectives, and improving engagement and transparency of approaches. There is a significant risk that without reconsidering energy modelling approaches, the role that the modelling community can play in providing effective decision support may be reduced. Such support is critical, as countries seek to develop new Nationally Determined Contributions and longer-term strategies over the next few years. Key policy insights Energy systems that reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions will be radically different to those of today, necessitating a modelling analysis re-think. On modelled options for mitigation, a range of demand-side measures are often absent resulting in a risk of over-reliance on carbon dioxide removal (CDR) and leading to concerns over robustness of corresponding pathways. Regarding models for policy, there is significant scope for improvements, including the use of scenarios that help imagine the radical change that will be required, techniques for improving the robustness of emerging strategies, and better alignment with broader policy goals.",Energy models; net-zero emissions; low carbon transitions; decision support,Article,2021.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3658417463302612,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5258608,How can academic research on UK agri-environment schemes pivot to meet the addition of climate mitigation aims?,"Agri-environment schemes were introduced in the UK in the 1980s as a response to the widespread environmental damage caused by post-war farming practices. Given such schemes are approaching forty years old, the academic literature is prolific and spans numerous fields including ecology, geography, economics and sociology. This paper reviews the existing literature on such schemes and discusses how it can contribute to benefit the explicit climate mitigation aims of more recent schemes. The focus is upon two key areas: the evaluation of environmental and social outcomes and recurring suggestions for innovation in these schemes. As schemes have been retrofitted to meet new climate aims over the years, moving on from a predominate focus on biodiversity loss, it is argued that academic research has an opportunity to contribute towards the co-design of schemes, with regards to mitigating climate change, especially in light of the key role land use will play in attaining negative emissions.

364090,Significance of blue carbon in ecological aquaculture in the context of interrelated issues: A case study of Costa Rica,"There is an increasing global awareness of the socioeconomic and ecological significance of coastal and marine ecosystems and aquaculture. Marine ecosystems have been substantially affected by unsustainable exploitation and abuse, leading to their degradation and decline in their capacity to provide ecosystems services. The focus of this chapter is on blue carbon stocks and their significance in coastal marine aquaculture. This chapter presents a holistic discussion of blue carbon and aquaculture, which touches upon multiple factors that are intricately linked, thus requiring elaboration of the complexity of the factors. In ecological aquaculture, stability of ecosystem is vitally important, and it is this stability which is threatened by aquaculture if carried out as an activity that is not consistent with the environmental thresholds. Many intensive aquaculture practices which disturbed the functional capacity of critical coastal ecosystem have failed to recognize the impacts of such activities on long-term food supply. Blue carbon is a term that has been coined to refer to carbon sequestration and storage in aquatic vegetation ecosystems. It is part of a trend in the sustainability literature that seeks to highlight the importance of ecosystem services in order to promote their conservation within diverse institutional alternatives to command and control policies. One of these alternatives is the global carbon market, which may provide financial incentives to protect and conserve natural ecosystems through the development of carbon offset projects. Specifically, blue carbon offset projects may provide additional incentives to protect and rehabilitate mangrove ecosystems in synchronization with aquaculture production. Aquaculture that is compatible with conservation of aquatic vegetation ecosystems is resilient and fares better in terms of sustainability. This not only helps aquaculture supply more aquatic food but also plays a responsible role towards fisheries and mitigating the effects of climate change. Given the fact that the topic of blue carbon is still in its nascent stage, there are a number of interrelated issues that need to be discussed to understand the key ingredients required to develop the linkages between blue carbon and aquaculture. An exclusive focus on blue carbon vis-à-vis aquaculture ignores the other related factors, resulting in a discussion that is not adequate in terms of its outcomes for integrated management of coastal marine resources for sustainable seafood supplies. This chapter, therefore, will distil the current science and implementation mechanisms of blue carbon projects and highlight their links with ecological aquaculture. The topic of blue carbon and aquaculture has not been discussed in scientific or grey literature, and this chapter intends to provide a novel approach that explains the synergies that may be achievable between blue carbon and ecological aquaculture through a case study in Costa Rica. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

425797,"A ton is not always a ton: A road-test of landfill, manure, and afforestation/reforestation offset protocols in the US carbon market","The outcome of recent international climate negotiations suggests we are headed toward a more fragmented carbon market, with multiple emission trading and offset programs operating in parallel. To effectively harmonize and link across programs, it will be important to ensure that across offset programs and protocols that a ""ton is a ton"". In this article, we consider how sample offsets projects in the U.S. carbon market are treated across protocols from five programs: the Clean Development Mechanism, Climate Action Reserve, Chicago Climate Exchange, Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and the U.S. EPA's former program, Climate Leaders. We find that differences among protocols for landfill methane, manure management, and afforestation/reforestation project types in accounting boundary definitions, baseline setting methods, measurement rules, emission factors, and discounts lead to differences in offsets credited that are often significant (e.g. greater than 50%). We suggest opportunities for modification and harmonization of protocols that can improve offset quality and credibility and enhance prospects for future linking of trading units and systems.

599712,Assessment of the US EPA's Determination of the Role for CO2 Capture and Storage in New Fossil Fuel-Fired Power Plants,"On September 20, 2013, the US Environmental and Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a revised rule for ""Standards of Performance for Greenhouse Gas Emissions from New Stationary Sources: Electric Utility Generating Units"". These performance standards set limits on the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) that can be emitted per megawatt-hour (MWh) of electricity generation from new coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants built in the US. These limits were based on determinations of ""best system of emission reduction (BSER) adequately demonstrated"". Central in this determination was evaluating whether Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) qualified as BSER. The proposed rule states that CCS qualifies as BSER for coal-fired generation but not for natural gas-fired generation. In this paper, we assess the EPA's analysis that resulted in this determination. We are not trying to judge what the absolute criteria are for CCS as the BSER but only the relative differences as related to coal- vs natural gas-fired technologies. We conclude that there are not enough differences between ""base load"" coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants to justify the EPA's determination that CCS is the BSER for coal-fired power plants but not for natural gas-fired power plants.",,Article,2014.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3591277301311493,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
291500,Rapid scale-up of negative emissions technologies: social barriers and social implications,"Negative emissions technologies have garnered increasing attention in the wake of the Paris target to curb global warming to 1.5 A degrees C. However, much of the literature on carbon dioxide removal focuses on technical feasibility, and several significant social barriers to scale-up of these technologies have been glossed over. This paper reviews the existing literature on the social implications of rapidly ramping up carbon dioxide removal. It also explores the applicability of previous empirical social science research on intersecting topics, with examples drawn from research on first- and second-generation biofuels and forest carbon projects. Social science fieldwork and case studies of land use change, agricultural and energy system change, and technology adoption and diffusion can help in both anticipating the social implications of emerging negative emissions technologies and understanding the factors that shape trajectories of technological development. By integrating empirical research on public and producer perceptions, barriers to adoption, conditions driving new technologies, and social impacts, projections about negative emissions technologies can become more realistic and more useful to climate change policymaking.",Carbon dioxide removal; Negative emissions; Food systems; Direct air capture; BECCS,Article,2016.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.357255071401596,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
773161,The UK Liability Framework for the Transport of CO2 for Offshore Carbon Capture and Storage Operations,"Carbon (dioxide) capture and storage (CCS) is one of the solutions for decarbonising society whereby CO2 is captured, transported, and injected into geological formations. It can be transported to offshore locations through pipelines or ships. Which method provides for a better deal for investors depends to an extent on the financial risk associated with these two methods, which in turn is linked with exposure to liability. This paper compares the potential liability arising from the carriage of CO2 by ships and by pipelines in the UK offshore context. The two modes of transport are governed by significantly different regimes, even though they concern the same material. It is argued that the transport of CO2 by ships and by pipelines poses similar risks and therefore they should have a similar liability regime. This would afford pipeline operators the economic advantages available to shipowners and incentivise investment in the transport phase of CCS.",carbon (dioxide) capture and storage (CCS); offshore; transport; ship; pipeline; liability; limitation; insurance,Article,2017.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3564965426921844,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
3875833,(CARBON) FARMING OUR WAY OUT OF CLIMATE CHANGE,"Numerous climate-related emergencies highlight the challenges and urgency posed by climate change: the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report, the Global Climate Action Summit in California, and international student walkouts, to name a few. While the IPCC Report sent an urgent cry to reduce total emissions and to achieve specific results-45% reduction by 2030 and net-zero emissions by 2050-reductions need to be combined with capturing and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Scientific studies have shown that an annual increase of 0.4% of carbon stored in soils would make it possible to stop the present increase in atmospheric CO2. This Article focuses on carbon farming, a Climate Smart Agriculture strategy that uses plants to capture and store atmospheric carbon dioxide in soil to achieve the IPCC Report goal. This Article makes two contributions. First, recognizing the potential of private certifications to drive sales and investment (Organic-Certified food sales soared to $100 billion in 2018), this Article designs a new Carbon Farming Certification with an Organic or Regenerative Agriculture certification as a base, and an add-on module to measure carbon sequestration. Second, a carbon farming certification becomes a linchpin to accessing a greater network of resources to scale-up carbon farming: farmers leverage the Certification to gain access to immediate and long-term financing; to unlock lucrative opportunities to sell carbon credits to those who purchase carbon offsets in California's cap-and-trade market; and to engage in forward contracting with major supply chains. State and local governments should leverage sequestered carbon metrics from Carbon Farming Certified-farms to demonstrate compliance with international law and treaty targets, as well as national and local climate policies. Filling gaps in food law and environmental governance literature, this Article presents a multidisciplinary approach to solving a critical global problem. It identifies barriers which hinder the scale-up of promising carbon farming strategies, including: insufficient information, lack of funding for innovation to drive down solution costs, inconsistent regulations that hinder project development and private sector commercialization, and a patchwork of quantification standards for ensuring carbon sequestration is measured consistently and fairly. The Article's proposed solution draws from new developments in computer modeling simulation and metrics, carbon credits, and global best practices.

Known as the National Initiative on CO2 Capture and Storage, it includes sharing information, encouraging collaboration and identifying a role for this option within Canada's GHG-reduction actions. There are three working groups. A CO2 capture group targets areas of interest that include absorption, O-2/CO2 combustion, and membrane and cryogenic separation. A geological storage group includes enhanced oil recovery (EOR), coalbed methane (CBM), deep saline aquifers, and an inventory of storage sites. A technology deployment group discusses the regulatory, royalty and tax infrastructure, which could have a bearing on deployment. This Initiative is a promising step towards realizing the CO2 capture and storage option. On the assumption that CO2 technologies are widely deployed, then this option has the potential of providing, a decade from now, a reduction of 30-40 Mt CO2 per year.

1712905,Integrated sustainability assessment of CCS - Identifying non-technical barriers and drivers for CCS implementation in Finland,"The aim of the paper is to discuss the sustainability of CCS technologies from a cross-disciplinary point of view. Due to the complex nature of the current sustainability challenges, such as climate change, which is the key driver for the development of CCS, trans-disciplinary research approaches are required to ensure that all relevant knowledge from disciplines and actor groups related to the problem is incorporated. The findings of the paper are based on a sustainability assessment conducted as part of a Finnish research project Carbon Capture and Storage Program (CCSP). The findings are analysed and integrated using the PESTEL framework, in which most important drivers and barriers having an impact on the general environment and on the potential implementation of CCS technologies in Finland are analysed. The results of the PESTEL analysis indicate that significant barriers at the moment lie in the economic and legal categories. Instead of fossil energy production, carbon capture and utilisation, or bio-CCS could perhaps be viable solutions in Finnish conditions. However, barriers related to price and legal framework would need to be overcome in these cases. Clear policy drivers could act as motivators for the industry and for the academia to continue development of the most potential and promising solutions, and would require ensuring availability of funding for pilot scale demonstrations. However, decision to invest in CCS is not only a technological, economical or legal question, but also an environmental, social, and even ethical question that relates to public acceptance and on the principles of sustainable development. In future, more attention should be paid to the interrelatedness of social and technical aspects of CCS, since open questions regarding the role and potential of CCS in moving towards low carbon future in Finland remain.

414682,"Agroforestry, reforestry, and the carbon problem: The role of land and tree tenure","Large scale reforestation in the tropics has the potential to sequester large amounts of carbon and to help to mitigate the buildup of atmospheric carbon dioxide. However, unless the causes of deforestation are addressed, reforestation efforts will be in vain. The link between deforestation and reforestation operates within the domain of human intervention on the landscape, and includes the patterns of land resource use and access. This review considers the role that land and tree tenure (resource use and access) of agroforestry can have in reducing both the rate of conversion of forest to agriculture – the largest biotic emission of carbon – and forest degradation; thereby allowing both natural forests and reforestation to participate in carbon uptake. The operational land use and tenure aspects of agroforestry, and the impacts of these on deforestation, and in overcoming the obstacles to large scale reforestation, are presented. Utilisation of marginal lands, and the adoption, growth, and spread of agroforestry systems in the carbon context, are also discussed. © 1995 Interdisciplinary Science Reviews.",,JOUR,1995.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3389833569526672,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

4915946,"The Importance of Alaska for Climate Stabilization, Resilience, and Biodiversity Conservation","Alaska is globally significant for its large tracts of intact habitats, which support complete wildlife assemblages and many of the world's healthiest wild fisheries, while also storing significant amounts of carbon. Alaska has 1/3 of United States federal lands, the bulk of the United States' intact and wild lands, and over half of the country's total terrestrial ecosystem carbon on federal lands. Managing Alaska's public lands for climate and biodiversity conservation purposes over the next 30-50 years would provide meaningful and irreplaceable climate benefits for the United States and globe. Doing so via a co-management approach with Alaska's 229 federally recognized tribes is likely not only to be more effective but also more socially just. This paper lays out the scientific case for managing Alaska's public lands for climate stabilization and resilience and addresses three primary questions: Why is Alaska globally meaningful for biodiversity and climate stabilization? Why should Alaska be considered as a key element of a climate stabilization and biodiversity conservation strategy for the United States?

1868363,Can monetary compensation ease the siting of CCS projects?,"In a recent article in the Journal of Environmental Psychology, Zaal et al. [1] presented the results of three experimental studies conducted to systematically examine the effectiveness of the offering of monetary compensation (i.e., the offering of cash to a local community) in the context of the siting of hazardous facilities. The current conference paper highlights the main results of this research and discusses the relevance of these findings for the specific context of CCS. (C) 2014 The Authors.

1793783,Capacity building in developing economies: building on the APEC and CSLF experience,"Developing countries such as China, India, Mexico and Brazil are major energy producers and users, and emitters of CO2, and these countries are becoming aware of both the need to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the atmosphere and of CO2 capture and storage (CCS) as an enabling technology. One of the challenges faced in the implementation of CCS technologies, particularly in developing countries, is the shortage, sometimes absence, of a skilled technical and scientific workforce, but also a lack of knowledge about, and understanding of this technology among decision makers. The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) initiated in 2004 the development of a capacity building program that consisted of developing training modules and offering training workshops in developing countries around the Pacific Rim that are major CO2 emitters such as China, South Korea and Mexico. At the same time, the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF) has established a Task Force on Capacity Building that has similarly developed a program for providing capacity building to the seven CSLF members that are developing economies. A series of capacity building workshops has been offered throughout 2007 and 2008. Based on the experience to date of both initiatives, some of the key learnings for future capacity building workshops are: 1) holding workshops in conjunction with a technical conference or similar event; 2) ensuring participation of key decision makers; 3) ensuring a varied workshop format; 4) ensuring that the workshop material addresses also the specific conditions of the host country; 5) ensuring organization of the material that allows flexible participation; and 6) providing printed material and simultaneous translation.

4917260,Tropical forest and peatland conservation in Indonesia: Challenges and directions,"Tropical forests and peatlands provide important ecological, climate and socio-economic benefits from the local to the global scale. However, these ecosystems and their associated benefits are threatened by anthropogenic activities, including agricultural conversion, timber harvesting, peatland drainage and associated fire. Here, we identify key challenges, and provide potential solutions and future directions to meet forest and peatland conservation and restoration goals in Indonesia, with a particular focus on Kalimantan. Through a round-table, dual-language workshop discussion and literature evaluation, we recognized 59 political, economic, legal, social, logistical and research challenges, for which five key underlying factors were identified. These challenges relate to the 3Rs adopted by the Indonesian Peatland Restoration Agency (Rewetting, Revegetation and Revitalization), plus a fourth R that we suggest is essential to incorporate into (peatland) conservation planning: Reducing Fires. Our analysis suggests that (a) all challenges have potential for impact on activities under all 4Rs, and many are inter-dependent and mutually reinforcing, implying that narrowly focused solutions are likely to carry a higher risk of failure; (b) addressing challenges relating to Rewetting and Reducing Fire is critical for achieving goals in all 4Rs, as is considering the local socio-political situation and acquiring local government and community support; and (c) the suite of challenges faced, and thus conservation interventions required to address these, will be unique to each project, depending on its goals and prevailing local environmental, social and political conditions. With this in mind, we propose an eight-step adaptive management framework, which could support projects in both Indonesia and other tropical areas to identify and overcome their specific conservation and restoration challenges.",fire; forest; Kalimantan; peat-swamp forest; restoration; revegetation; revitalization; rewetting,Review,2020.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3178698122501373,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0

The errors appeared in abstract, results and discussion (subheadings 3.2 and 3.5) and in the conclusion. In results and discussion under subheading 3.2 (countries/region participation), the publication details of U.K. were mistakenly split into four namely, England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland with each constituent analysed as a country. This significantly affected the productivity of U.K. In results and discussion under subheading 3.5 (Participating authors), the errors were due to arrangements and abbreviations of authors names retrieved from the Web of Science. The corrections made are given below. Abstract, line 9–11 With these motivating factors, 49 countries engaged in carbon capture technologies and related research in which the United Kingdom had the most research output followed by the United States, and China. Results and discussion 3.2 Countries/regions participation, first paragraph: A total of 49 countries were involved in research related to CCT all over the world. Among these countries, only 24 countries have a minimum of 10 publications (see Fig. 4) with most publications on post-combustion capture followed by pre-combustion capture (see Table 1). Oxy-fuel combustion had the least number of publication. In terms of total number of publications (TP), the U.K. topped the table (total publications 171) followed by the U.S.A. (total publications of 146) and China (total publications 120). The research output suggested that these countries were leading the research on carbon capture and storage for greenhouse gas emissions abatement. This was not unexpected since the U.S.A. and China are the top two emitters of CO2 worldwide (“Climate change report card: These countries are reaching targets”, 2019) and the campaign for net-zero emission has been intensified in the U.K. in recent times. Conversely, the countries with the least publications on CCT related research were Bangladesh, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Tunisia, Turkey and Vietnam with only one publication each. In terms of total number of citations (TC), the U.S.A. had the highest citations. The top ten countries in order of citation were the U.S.A. (4416 citations) &gt; U.K. (3607 citations) &gt; Germany (2505 citations) &gt; Netherlands (1971 citations) &gt; Norway (1911 citations) &gt; Australia (1888 citations) &gt; China (1876 citations) &gt; France (1795 citations) &gt; Canada (1367 citations) &gt; Spain (1161 citations). Continentally, Europe was the most active continent (53.86% of the total publications) and the second highest percentage came from Asia (20.68%), while Africa and South America were the least active continents (0.68% publications) (see Fig. 5). 3.5 Participating Authors 3.5.1 Co-authorship of authors, first paragraph An author's number of publications and citations are an indication of experts in a given field as well as the visibility of their research output. Among the authors retrieved, Paul Feron affiliated with CSIRO was the most published author (33 publications) followed by Meihong Wang affiliated with the University of Sheffield (28 publications), Paitoon Tontiwachwuthikul affiliated with the University of Regina (21 publications), Eric Favre affiliated with University of Lorraine (20 publications), Raphael Idem affiliated with University of Regina (20 publications) and Mathieu Lucquiaud affiliated with the University of Edinburgh (20 publications) (see Fig. 9). Interestingly, Jeffrey R. Long affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley and with only 4 publications was the most cited author (1151 citations) followed by Meihong Wang (1096 citations), Praveen Linga affiliated with the National University of Singapore (936 citations), Adekola Lawal affiliated with the Process System Enterprise (907 citations), Zoey R. Herm affiliated with the University of California, Berkeley (840 citations) and Rajamani Krishna affiliated with the University of Amsterdam (840 citations). It is worth noting that the authors Richard Baker, Haiqing Lin, Tim C. Merkel and Xiaotong Wei affiliated with Membrane Technology and Research (MTR), Inc. who had only one topical publication received 680 citations each. Conclusions and future outlook In this study, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of publications on CCT related research in the past 20 years (1998–2018) in order to show the status and trends in the application of the three main technologies, namely pre-combustion capture, post-combustion capture and oxy-fuel combustion. The findings from this work include the following: • A total of 1020 publications including articles and proceedings papers with the keywords “post-combustion”, “pre-combustion” and “oxy-fuel combustion” were retrieved from WoS database for the period 1998 to 2018. • 49 countries actively participated in CCT related research where the United Kingdom was the most productive country followed by the United States, and China based on criteria for number of publications and citations. • In terms of continents, Europe had the greatest productivity, followed by Asia. The least productive continents were South America and Africa. • CSIRO was the most active institution (based on number of publications) while SINTEF was the most cited institution. • A total of 202 journals participated in the publications of the articles and proceedings papers considered in this study. Among these journals, International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control has the greatest productivity in terms of both number of publication and citations. The high productivity by International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control was ascribed to its more specialised aim of publishing work relating to greenhouse gas emissions and climate change mitigation via carbon dioxide capture, transport and storage as compared to other journals that are majorly multidisciplinary. • Paul Feron was the most productive author in terms of publication, followed by Meihong Wang. In terms of citation number, Jeffrey R. Long was the most influential author followed by Meihong Wang, and Praveen Linga. • Post-combustion capture was the most covered CCT with over 80.9% of the 1020 publications retrieved, whilst oxy-fuel combustion was the least covered with 3.4% of the total publications.

359858,Earth Systems Engineering: The Role of Industrial Ecology in an Engineered World,"A principal result of the Industrial Revolution and concomitant changes in human population levels, technology systems, and culture has been the evolution of a world in which the dynamics of major natural systems are increasingly dominated by human activity. Many resulting anthropogenic perturbations of fundamental natural systems - for example, the nitrogen and carbon cycles and heavy metal stocks and flows - have been both unanticipated and problematic. Reducing such unintended consequences of human activity will require development of the ability to rationally engineer and manage coupled human natural systems in a highly integrated fashion. Such ""earth systems engineering"" activity will rely on industrial ecology studies and methodologies to provide critical elements of the required science and technology (S&T) base. Although the need to develop such an earth systems engineering/industrial ecology capability is clear, it is also apparent that the current S&T base, institutional structures, and ethical systems are inadequate to support such activity. Accordingly, it is desirable to begin to develop such support structures while recognizing that premature attempts to engineer fundamental natural systems should be discouraged.",,JOUR,1998.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3143910467624664,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
225873,Biochar: Examination of an emerging concept to sequester carbon,"Biochar is a charcoal produced under high temperatures using crop residues, animal manure, or any type of organic waste material. Depending on the feedstock, biochar may look similar to potting soil or to a charred substance. The combined production and use of biochar is considered a carbon-negative process, meaning that it removes carbon from the atmosphere. Biochar has multiple potential environmental benefits, foremost the potential to sequester carbon in the soil for hundreds to thousands of years at an estimate. Studies suggest that crop yields can increase as a result of applying biochar as a soil amendment. Some contend that biochar has value as an immediate climate change mitigation strategy. Scientific experiments suggest that greenhouse gas emissions are reduced significantly with biochar application to crop fields. Obstacles that may stall rapid adoption of biochar production systems include technology costs, system operation and maintenance, feedstock availability, and biochar handling. Biochar research anddevelopment is in its infancy. Nevertheless, interest in biochar as a multifaceted solution to agricultural and natural resource issues is growing at a rapid pace both nationally and internationally. Past Congresses have proposed numerous climate change bills, many of which do not directly address mitigation and adaptation technologies at developmental stages, such as biochar. However, biochar may equip agricultural and forestry producers with numerous revenue-generating products: carbon offsets, soil amendments, and energy. This report briefly describes biochar, some of its potential advantages and disadvantages, legislative support, and research and development activities underway in the United States. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

655806,Capability development of local communities for project sustainability in afforestation/reforestation clean development mechanism,"It has been recognized that the involvement of local community is essential to ensure the sustainability of A/R CDM (afforestation/reforestation clean development mechanism) project. This study verifies if the risks of non-permanence and leakage are addressed in a registered small scale A/R CDM project in Vietnam. Workshops, interviews, and a questionnaire survey of local villagers revealed that the project has caused a shortage of land for conventional activities such as grazing, fuel wood collection and shifting cultivation, and consequently posed the risks of project non-permanence and leakage. It is suggested that participation of all stakeholders in the community to the A/R CDM project beyond existing land tenure and adequate carbon benefit sharing according to the level of contribution to the project are required to reduce the risk of non permanence. To ensure the participation, the community should have capability such as consensus building and collective action. Leakage would be minimized if the community has alternative measures to the conventional activities before starting the project. We argue that it is necessary to first develop a community's capabilities in the readiness phase of any A/R CDM project in order to reduce the risks for the project sustainability, and that new sources of funding are needed for this purpose.",A/R CDM; Capacity building; Community forestry; Forest carbon project; Payment for environmental services (PES); Sustainable forest management; REDD,Article,2012.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.3074818551540375,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0

Advanced research is under way on ambitious methods to alter the earth's climate, from increasing the planet's reflectivity, by seeding the atmosphere with SO 2, to altering the composition of its oceans to increase CO 2 absorption. A study from the US House of Representatives' Committee on Science and Technology - Geoengineering the climate: research needs and strategies for international co-ordination - has been released. Possible solutions fall into two broad categories - those that reduce the amount of sunlight reaching the earth - so-called solar-radiation management (SRM) - and those that provide ways to remove CO 2 from the atmosphere and store it. CO 2-removal technology is already under development in the form of carbon capture and storage, but the possibility of stripping CO 2 directly, or indirectly from the atmosphere is also being considered. Technologies for stripping CO 2 from the atmosphere an another CO 2-absorption technology, biochar production, are discussed.",,JOUR,2010.0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0.305188238620758,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0
5283160,Proactive and reactive geoengineering: Engineering the climate and the lithosphere,"In recent years, the idea of geoengineering, understood as large-scale interventions in the planet's climate to counteract anthropogenic climate change, has steadily increased its visibility. Presented explicitly as an approach to climate change, geoengineering is positioned as a response, a reactive fix. Geoengineering, however, has a longer and broader history than the current climate crisis. It has long been an umbrella term for large-scale projects in which various Earth sciences meet dreams about human ecosphere interventions, especially regarding lithosphere and climate and weather modifications. In this paper, we review the history of geoengineering, focusing specifically on climate geoengineering and lithosphere geoengineering. We draw attention to the difference between ""proactive"" (""high-modernist""), aimed at mastery over nature, and ""reactive"" forms of geoengineering, hoping to address anthropogenic environmental degradation technologically. Additionally, we trace historical (dis)continuities between the older, proactive, form of geoengineering and their recent reframing as a technological fix-specifically around the question to what extent nature's complex systems can be known and controlled. Finally, we argue for the need to further research the intersections and shared histories between various forms of geoengineering.

4371214,Measuring technological collaborations on carbon capture and storage based on patents: A social network analysis approach,"With huge technical potential, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is widely regarded as an important means of addressing climate change. International technological collaboration on CCS appears particularly crucial to help expedite commercial-scale deployment globally. This study investigates CCS patents and measures technological collaborations among CCS research communities by looking at a global patent cooperation network. Using a social network analysis method, network properties, network actors and cohesive subgroups were examined. The collaborative strength of patentees is also investigated, along with an analysis of the breadth and depth of technological collaboration. The results show that the overall collaboration network of CCS is still at an early stage of development; CCS enterprises and relevant R&D organizations have not established close partnerships. Based on the findings, two suggestions are proposed in order to promote more successful technological collaborations, including the creation of CCS patent pools and the construction of CCS knowledge sharing platforms.

868850,Integrated Sustainability Assessment of CCS - Identifying Non-technical Barriers and Drivers for CCS Implementation in Finland,"The aim of the paper is to discuss the sustainability of CCS technologies from a cross-disciplinary point of view. Due to the complex nature of the current sustainability challenges, such as climate change, which is the key driver for the development of CCS, trans-disciplinary research approaches are required to ensure that all relevant knowledge from disciplines and actor groups related to the problem is incorporated. The findings of the paper are based on a sustainability assessment conducted as part of a Finnish research project Carbon Capture and Storage Program (CCSP). The findings are analysed and integrated using the PESTEL framework, in which most important drivers and barriers having an impact on the general environment and on the potential implementation of CCS technologies in Finland are analysed. The results of the PESTEL analysis indicate that significant barriers at the moment lie in the economic and legal categories. Instead of fossil energy production, carbon capture and utilisation, or bio-CCS could perhaps be viable solutions in Finnish conditions. However, barriers related to price and legal framework would need to be overcome in these cases. Clear policy drivers could act as motivators for the industry and for the academia to continue development of the most potential and promising solutions, and would require ensuring availability of funding for pilot scale demonstrations. However, decision to invest in CCS is not only a technological, economical or legal question, but also an environmental, social, and even ethical question that relates to public acceptance and on the principles of sustainable development. In future, more attention should be paid to the interrelatedness of social and technical aspects of CCS, since open questions regarding the role and potential of CCS in moving towards low carbon future in Finland remain.
