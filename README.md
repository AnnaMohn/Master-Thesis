Titel: How negative emission technologies can be regulated and certified. A systematic mapping of the scientific literature on  policy instruments for carbon dioxide removal

This repository shows the code which I developed for my master thesis. The files are sorted by their apparence in the thesis. Hence, the data is first cleaned (File A) and the graphs for the systematic mapping are then created in file B-E. File F creates a subset that was used for the qualitative analysis and File G creates the graph that displays the knowledge on certification criteria.

All relevant data is uploaded in the folder MT data. There you can find the 13 datasets which I retrieved from NACSOS during the coding process. Furthermore, I added the file with the predictions on the CDR technologies. This file was created by the MCC. The folder also contains a file named long_lat_new.xlsx, which I created when manually checking for all locations retrieved by NER. Finally, I added the file with the coding results of my analysis on the certification of removals which I used in File G.
