Titel: How negative emission technologies can be regulated and certified. A systematic mapping of the scientific literature on  policy instruments for carbon dioxide removal

This repository shows the code I developed for my master thesis. The files are sorted according to their occurence in the thesis. Hence, the data is first cleaned. This is done in two different files, the first containing new datasets with basic information such as the year of publication (File A1) and the second containing information on policy instruments and CDR technologies (File A2). Based on this, the graphs for the systematic mapping are then created in Files B-E. File F creates a subset that was used for the qualitative analysis and in File G the graph is created that displays the knowledge about the certification criteria.

All relevant data is uploaded in the MT data folder. There you can find the 13 datasets that I retrieved from NACSOS during the coding process. Furthermore, I added the file with the predictions on the CDR technologies. This file was created by the MCC. The folder also contains a file named long_lat_new.xlsx that I created during the manual review of all locations retrieved from NER. Finally, I have added the file with the coding results of my analysis on the certification of removals, which I used in File G.
